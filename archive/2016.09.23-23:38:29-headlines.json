Yet that hasn't stopped <a href=\"http://skirtingtherules.com/how-a-sanitary-pad-project-benefits-both-girls-education-and-the-environment/\" target=\"_hplink\">Shana Greene</a> from making it her mission to provide school-age girls with hygienic and affordable menstrual supplies. <br />\n<br />\nWhy? Getting your period is one of the biggest reasons for girls to miss school in these communities, making them more likely to fall behind, drop out, and get stuck in the cycle of poverty. In fact, the <em><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-cant-afford-sanitary-napkins-reveals-study/articleshow/7344998.cms\" target=\"_hplink\">Times of India</a></em> reported that nearly a quarter of Indian girls drop out of school once they start their periods, and about 70 percent say their families can't afford pads.<br />\n<br />\nGreene, founder and director of Seattle-based nonprofit <a href=\"http://villagevolunteers.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">Village Volunteers</a>' <a href=\"http://www.empoweringwomenperiod.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">Empowering Women. Period</a>.--a project that develops microenterprises that enable impoverished women in India and, soon, Kenya, to make biodegradable pads from fast-growing water hyacinth--is turning the enormous problem of a destructive weed that harms fresh water supplies into a three-pronged solution. <br />\n<br />\n\"[We were able to] sidestep the traditional problem-solution models that tightly focus on a single solution to a single problem. We instead developed a solution with a multidimensional approach: A viable way to handle menstruation, which keeps many girls in developing countries from going to school, while fighting poverty by providing income at the same time and easing an environmental threat,\" says Greene of the project's inception.<br />\n<br />\nShe credits part of what led to the creative solution was an ability to collaborate. An easy idea in theory, but typically very difficult to practice in regions with crushing poverty that are often mired in corruption. For example, Greene partnered with Urmi Basu, the director and founder of <a href=\"http://www.newlightindia.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">New Light</a>, an organization that provides shelters and education to the children of sex workers in Kolkata, one of the oldest red light districts in India. <br />\n<br />\nWith Basu's help, the first Empowering Women. Period. microenterprise was launched near this city where, according to the New Light website, roughly 40,000 new trafficked sex workers enter each year. It's a region where economic empowerment for women in the forms of education and income can help change a culture of inequality, and prevent <em>another</em> generation from turning to sex work.<br />\n<br />\nConsidering the problems that women face during menstruation in areas of poverty, Greene stresses the importance of listening to women who don't traditionally hold paths to power. \"When you listen, and the person knows you are interested in her viewpoint, you will hear what she wants to tell you as opposed to what she <em>thinks</em> you want to hear,\" says Greene.<br />\n<br />\n\"Organizations need to ask those people they're trying to help what works for them, and not make assumptions when offering solutions,\" says Greene. \"For example, re-useable cloth pads have been widely distributed. However, without available soap, water and privacy to wash and dry the pads, they carry dangerous bacteria. To make it worse, girls often dry them under their beds and wear them damp, which causes fungal and bacterial infections. Another solution that has been introduced is menstrual cups, which are also a challenge to keep clean when you don't have access to running water. Moreover, in many communities around the world, tampons or menstrual cups are taboo for young women.\"<br />\n<br />\nUltimately, when coming up against a myriad of issues while trying to create a sustainable solution and a business where the marginalized women who work are paid fairly and get health insurance, Greene pulled from the expertise of friends on four continents. (In addition to working from the U.S with partners in India and Kenya, a team from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden created the prototype of the biodegradable sanitary pad that helped the project happen). What kept her going is her inner knowing that she needed to push through.  Throughout the process, she connected the dots in a non-linear way in order to help discover this remarkable solution.<br />\n <br />\n\"For Empowering Women. Period, a giant leap needed to be taken to think that one problem could possibly solve another. The issues around water hyacinth causing people to lose access to fresh water, fishing, and the biodiversity of their lakes was in no way related to girls not having sanitary pads,\" says Greene. \"When we found out that water hyacinth was absorbent, I would not stop until the concept became a reality to make affordable biodegradable pads from the destructive aquatic weed that destroys water supplies and the fishing industry.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to crediting collaboration across four continents, the ability to truly listen, and following her intuition for the pad project's success, she says that, in an environment where it seems like every aspect of the system is working against you--such as social stigma surrounding women's menstruation and lack of funding--the launch came down to sheer perseverance. <br />\n<br />\n\"...perhaps my secret talent is that I don't give up, especially on what I believe to be something that will change the lives of women. This particular project has been nearly eight years in the making,\" says Greene. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>Related Stories</strong><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://skirtingtherules.com/how-breaking-the-rules-can-change-your-life-and-the-world/\" target=\"_hplink\">How Breaking the Rules Can Help You Succeed--And Change The World</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://skirtingtherules.com/what-tracking-my-time-for-an-entire-year-taught-me-about-productivity/\" target=\"_hplink\"><br />\nWhat Tracking My Time for An Entire Year Taught Me About Productivity</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://skirtingtherules.com/why-financial-freedom-is-so-important-to-living-your-dreams/\" target=\"_hplink\">Why Financial Freedom Is So Important for Living Your Dreams</a> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "How a Sanitary Pad Project in India Benefits Both Girls' Education and the Environment", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/skirting-the-rules/how-a-sanitary-pad-projec_b_12079850.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 1, "description": "Two more black men have been shot and killed by police: in Charlotte, North Carolina (Keith Lamont Scott) and in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Terence Crutcher).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>WARNING: THESE VIDEOS ARE GRAPHIC AND THE AUDIO UNSETTLING AND EXPLICIT.</strong><br />\n<strong><br />\nThis is a tale of two cities.<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn one city, there is police accountability and no rioting.

Right now, the normal seasonal increase in coxsackie virus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) is in full swing and we are seeing tons of kids with typical symptoms in the office. Even the mention of hand, foot mouth disease can send typically calm parents into full panic. I'm hoping after reading this article, that parents will realize that while this illness can certainly make your little one feel very uncomfortable, it is rarely life threatening or dangerous. Typically, with some time, love and good pain control, your little one will seem back to himself in a few days. <br />\n<br />\n<em>Here's are five things your <a href=\"http://wellroundedny.com/picking-your-pediatrician/\" target=\"_hplink\">pediatrician</a> wants you to know about hand, foot and mouth disease:<br />\n</em><br />\n <br />\n<strong>1. It's a virus. </strong>Hand, foot and mouth disease is an infection that is caused by a virus known as the coxsackie virus. I like to tell parents, \"it's a virus with a name.\" It is no different than your child having a cold, it is just a different set of symptoms. And just because a virus has a name does not mean it will make a child sicker or is more dangerous than other viruses. Fun fact: it is named after a town in upstate New York where the virus was discovered. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Symptoms can vary. </strong>Typical symptoms include: fever, sores on the back of the throat, fussiness, and a rash on the hands, feet and often buttocks. The rash typically looks like small red raised spots or bump and can look like blisters. The sores in the mouth can be very painful and may cause your little one to have increased drooling or decreased <a href=\"http://wellroundedny.com/introducing-solids-101/\" target=\"_hplink\">food intake</a>. The rash is not usually painful but can sometimes cause a little itching. It is possible for a child to have hand, foot and mouth without having a fever. Not everyone who contracts this virus will have the exact same symptoms.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. It's very contagious. </strong>The coxsackie virus is very contagious. It is spread by contact with an infected person's saliva, mucous, or traces of bowel movements. Children are most contagious while they have fevers and sores in the mouth. Good hand washing, especially after changing diapers, is super important. It is also important to clean toys, table tops and other things your little one is touching. Unfortunately, this virus has multiple strains, so even if your child already had this virus, he or she can get it again, even in the same season. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. The treatment is NOT antibiotics. </strong> Since the infection itself is a virus, the treatment goals are keeping your little one comfortable and hydrated. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be very helpful with pain control. Dosing is weight based and can be found on the <a href=\"http://premierpedsny.com\" target=\"_hplink\">Premier Pediatrics website</a>. Never give aspirin to children. Encourage your little one to drink, and try to give him or her cool liquids or foods. The cool temperature helps relieve throat pain plus it gives them liquids. If you have any concerns about your child (such as he or she seems unusually irritable or lethargic, has headache or neck stiffness, is refusing to drink, is running fevers for more than three days), you should call your pediatrician right away.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Yes, adults can get it!</strong> While, coxsackie virus is more common in children, adults can contract this illness as well.<br />\n<br />\nLately, it does seem like everyone has coxsackie virus. But try not to worry too much: the virus is rarely dangerous and typically resolves on its own with time. So, while it's a major bummer if your little one and/or you get it, you are in good company and can feel better knowing that, hopefully, your little one only needs 5 to 7 days to be up and running again. And don't forget that hand washing is the best method of prevention, so load up on the soap and water and get scrubbing!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>More from Well Rounded NY:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://wellroundedny.com/newborn-concerns-germs/\" target=\"_hplink\">How to Deal with Germs and Your Newborn</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://wellroundedny.com/nailing-your-breastfeeding-schedule/\" target=\"_hplink\">Nailing Your Breastfeeding Schedule</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://wellroundedny.com/introducing-solids-101/\" target=\"_hplink\">Everything You Need to Know About Introducing Solids to Your Baby</a><br />\n<br />\n<em>This piece was originally published on <a href=\"http://wellroundedny.com/whats-hand-foot-mouth-disease/\" target=\"_hplink\">Well Rounded NY</a>, and written by Deena Blanchard MD, MPH.

In updating it, we realized how so much of it is already happening. So, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/04/10-ways-technology-could-change-aging_n_7155100.html\">welcome to an edited version of the time capsule that we ran in May 2015</a>. And when will that <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/transportation/20160918_Exhilarating__and_a_little_frightening__a_ride_in_a_self-driving_car.html\" target=\"_blank\">self-driving car</a> be ready?</p><br />\n<div class=\"entry__content js-entry-content\"><br />\n<div class=\"entry__body js-entry-body\"><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<p>Technology is changing everything, including how we will age and the quality of our senior years. Mobile devices, wearable gadgets, and Internet-based technologies will help older adults age in place while monitoring their health and safety. We took a look at 10 things that loom in our technological futures.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>1. Talking street signs.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br />Night driving is a real bugaboo for seniors. Our vision weakens as we age and eventually we reach the point where we don&rsquo;t trust our ability to find places once the sun sets. GPS systems have given us a little more confidence that we won&rsquo;t get lost, but what would really be terrific would be talking street signs that announce themselves via our Bluetooth as we approach.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>2. Cars that drive themselves.</strong></h4><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<p>We know this is just around the corner, so to speak. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/01/06/bmws-self-driving-car-parks-itself-and-picks-you-up-when-youre-ready-to-go/\" target=\"_hplink\">We&rsquo;d be happy just to have cars that parallel park themselves.</a>&nbsp;Automotive technology is working toward making us all safer drivers, but for seniors, there&rsquo;s an even keener interest: It could easily help keep them safe on the road longer. The ability to drive, many believe, is at the core of independence. Cars of the future will be able to recognize unsafe driving conditions or when the driver isn&rsquo;t paying attention and make automatic adjustments to steer the vehicle away from a potential accident.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">&nbsp;</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>3. The doctor will see you now &mdash; on Skype.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br /><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2012-08-23/the-doctor-will-skype-you-now\" target=\"_hplink\">Video-call doctors&rsquo; visits have already been a boon to those who live in rural areas</a>. Expect that the trend toward more telemedicine will continue. One day we&rsquo;ll be saying &ldquo;Remember when we used to have to go into an office to see the doctor?&rdquo; just like we now say &ldquo;Remember when doctors used to make house calls?&rdquo;</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>4. Remote patient monitoring.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br />Patients can already check their glucose levels and download the results to their doctors. Watch for the expansion of point-of-care monitoring devices, such as weight scales, heart and blood pressure monitors that send your readings directly to the doctor. In many cases, these devices obviate the need to visit the doctor&rsquo;s office. Many of the routine services that doctors traditionally have provided in their office are changing. Pharmacies already offer a lower cost way of getting your blood pressure checked and your annual flu shot. Not going to see the doctor also means no co-pays.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>5. Online medical records.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br /><a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/electronic-records-private-lives?page=2\" target=\"_hplink\">Privacy concerns notwithstanding,</a> there is a huge plus to having all your doctors on the same page &mdash; literally. Test results can be shared, medical conferencing can be conducted online, and you and your loved ones can all have the same information in front of you. It&rsquo;s easier to get second opinions when all you need to do is send your test results to another doctor on a secured connection. Specialists who are in different cities or countries can consult with one another. We communicate electronically now anyway. We bank and engage in e-commerce daily. Why not use technology when it comes to medical records? As for the privacy issue, it absolutely exists. But remember: Nobody has ever died from the inappropriate release of a medical record, while plenty have died because people couldn&rsquo;t get access to this information.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>6. Robots as caregivers.</strong></h4><br />\n<p>A Japanese engineer has developed a Robot-Teddy Bear. It looks adorable and is intended to perform tasks like lifting an elderly person out of bed and helping them stand up or move into a wheelchair. Robear is the brainchild of Toshiharu Mukai, head of the Robot Sensor Systems Research Team at the Riken-SRK Collaboration Center for Human-Interactive Robot Research since 2007. Health workers perform this lifting task with patients about 40 times a day.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>7. Lights, lights and more lights.</strong></h4><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<p>Nothing against restaurants that set a romantic mood with candles, but we can&rsquo;t read your menus. Watch for LED lights showing up in places you never expected &mdash; including at the top of the list of specials the chef is featuring tonight. <a href=\"http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=51156936&amp;SiteId=QFGLnEolOWg-xXdApKZr17I024P_T2ooyQ\" target=\"_hplink\">There&rsquo;s even a Ralph Lauren tote bag with LED lights on the inside to help you see when you go fishing for your pen.</a></p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>8. Safety monitors that go way beyond nanny-cams.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br />Future sensors will include information about lifestyle habits and patterns. There will be sensors to alert you if your elderly mom hasn&rsquo;t turned on her TV in two days when you &mdash; and the sensor &mdash; know she never misses her favorite shows. How about a pill-dispenser that sends you an email if Mom has missed a dose? Or a motion sensor in the bathroom that reports if Dad has fallen and automatically calls 911 for help? Motion sensors monitor the speed and frequency of movement throughout the house and can let a caregiver know if someone hasn&rsquo;t gotten out of bed. The sensors can also track when seniors visit the fridge to make sure they are eating. And sensors near the stove know if a pot was removed and the burner left on.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>9. Homes will age along with us.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br />Walk-in tubs, stair lifts, lower cabinets, and waist-high power outlets so the elderly don&rsquo;t need to bend down to the baseboards to charge their devices are all simple changes in home design that will make aging in place easier. Throw in some smart technology alert systems and many concerns of the elderly are addressed. Expect sensors that alert you to things like the garage door being left open or that the front door is unlocked. Finders for the TV remote, the telephone and your car keys will all be a standard part of home design. Lights will turn on as soon as your feet hit the floor when you get up to use the bathroom at 1 a.m. Appliances will &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to each other: Your refrigerator will send your TV a message saying you left its door open.</p><br />\n</div><br />\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\"><br />\n<h4><strong>10. More apps &mdash; for everything.</strong></h4><br />\n<p><br />There are apps that help you track weight, exercise, calories, etc. There will be more apps that help you understand your body, your illnesses, your surgeries, your medications and their possible side effects. <a href=\"http://www.longevitynetwork.org/news/health-apps-created-by-surgeons-put-patients-in-control/\" target=\"_hplink\">My Recovery app, </a>designed by a surgeon, would help patients prepare for their operation, to understand what to expect during and after their hospital stay, and to guide them through any necessary rehabilitative physiotherapy exercises individually tailored to their needs. Then there&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.flowygame.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">Flowy, an app that uses games to help people </a>manage panic attacks.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2015/03/20/health-apps-created-surgeons-put-patients-control-313531.html\" target=\"_hplink\">It&rsquo;s already had one pilot trial that found that users showed a significant decline in symptoms compared to a control group, reported Newsweek</a>. There will be apps with exercises that are prescribed just for you by your physical therapist, who will be able to see whether you&rsquo;ve done them and send you reminders if you haven&rsquo;t.</p><br />\n<p>All we can say is ... here&rsquo;s to the future!</p><br />\n</div><br />\n</div><br />\n</div> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "The 10 Ways Tech Is Changing How We Age", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/09/15/the-10-ways-tech-is-changing-how-we-age_n_12163648.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 5, "description": "<br />\n<p>U.S. Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary<span class=\"highlight\"> Clinton </span></a>has postponed a trip planned for Sunday to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/charlotte/\">Charlotte</a>, North Carolina, which has seen sometimes violent protests after a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/charlotte-shooting/\">black man was killed by police</a> earlier this week.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;Hillary is grateful for, and intends to honor, the invitation from faith leaders to visit with the Charlotte community,&rdquo; her campaign said in a statement on Friday.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday&rsquo;s trip as to not impact the city&rsquo;s resources,&rdquo; it said, adding that<span class=\"highlight\"> Clinton </span>will visit the city on the following Sunday.</p><br />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/clinton-to-visit-charlotte-on-sunday/\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts told CNN</a> that it would be preferable if Clinton postpone the visit.</p><br />\n<div class=\"embed-asset embed\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Mayor Roberts on CNN says she  would prefer Clinton delay planned Sun trip to Charlotte to not stress security resources. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CharlotteProtest?src=hash\">#CharlotteProtest</a></p>&mdash; Jamie Boll WBTV (@JamieBollWBTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamieBollWBTV/status/779458134154805248\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote><br />\n</div></div><br />\n     <br />\n<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was also reportedly to delay a trip to the city next week, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/23/politics/clinton-to-visit-charlotte-on-sunday/\" target=\"_blank\">unnamed campaign officials told CNN</a>.</p><br />\n<div class=\"embed-asset embed\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Two Trump sources tell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Acosta\">@Acosta</a> that the Republican nominee is no longer planning a post-debate trip to Charlotte. <a href=\"https://t.co/bZl58jyWbH\">https://t.co/bZl58jyWbH</a></p>&mdash; Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/779500785734414336\">September 24, 2016</a></blockquote><br />\n</div></div><br />\n     <br />\n<div class=\"embed-asset embed\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand.

Both candidates have a history of disparaging comments, from Donald Trump's \"Lying Hillary\" to Hillary Clinton's \"Basket of Deplorables.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe format for the debates have long been set, however, they give the moderator the authority to \"regulate the conversation so that thoughtful and substantive exchanges occur\" to better achieve the commission's mission of \"providing the best possible information to viewers and listeners.\" <br />\n<br />\nThis is how the moderator could ensure the debates are civil and regulate the dialogue to meet the commission's mission:  <br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>Tell the candidates their demeanor must be respectful their opponents as people even if they don't embrace their points of view.</li><br />\n</ul><br />\n<ul><li>Affirm that the objective of the debate is to learn each candidate's own positions, not to blame or praise others.</li><br />\n<br />\n<li>Disallow any comments, that, in the moderator's opinion, disparage any person on stage or elsewhere.</li><br />\n<br />\n<li>Ask the candidates to answer this question as their opening statement: what are the three most important professional or volunteer positions you have held that qualify you to be president, and why do they qualify you?</li><br />\n<br />\n<li>Ask each candidate to describe in detail the three most important steps he or she would take to address each subject and to share how the country would be improved if their solutions were adopted, using understandable examples. </li><br />\n<br />\n<li>To ensure respectful demeanor is a two-way street, the moderator will promise not to ask \"do you still beat your wife\" questions designed to trap the candidates or embarrass them.</li><br />\n<br />\n<li>To maintain respectful dialogue, the moderator should be able to mute the microphone of each candidate. Each time a candidate is disrespectful, disparaging, or otherwise violates the moderator's rules for civil dialogue, he or she would be silenced for five minutes. </li><br />\n</ul><br />\nThe likelihood of this proposal being adopted is small because the entertainment value of name-calling and disparaging opponents is far greater than that of civil dialogue, even though an adult information exchange would be welcomed by many.

If ever that assertion received proof, it certainly does with Mike Bartlett's <em>King Charles III</em>.\" The brilliant drama-comedy, which collected awards and raves in London and New York, opened American Conservatory Theater's 50th season in San Francisco's Geary Theater on Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\n\tBut a play needs more than an outstanding script to be successful, as anyone who has slumped through a mangling of <em>King Lear</em> knows well. The words offer a starting point; the direction, performances and technical support make it connect.<br />\n<br />\n\tThat's a wordy way of getting to my feeling that Bartlett's text -- a vision of Great Britain's royal family and the British nation after the death of Queen Elizabeth -- is marvelous: inventive, thoughtful and literate. But ACT's staging, directed by David Muse, dispatches it with only intermittent flashes of human or intellectual engagement.<br />\n<br />\n\tModeled essentially on the form of Shakespeare's history plays and written for the most part in blank verse, Bartlett's <em>Charles</em> is rich with personalities and motivations that suggest Shakespearean antecedents. It speculates not only on conflicts within the royal family after the longest reign in British history but also on the institution of the monarchy and its relation to the people that it nominally rules. Most poignantly and powerfully, though, it examines issues of morality, power, self-interest and public interest among figures who control the destiny of a nation.<br />\n<br />\n\tEven if the specifics involve structures that are uniquely British, the principles apply to every democracy.<br />\n<br />\n\tBartlett's characters come straight from contemporary history, and especially from the lurid pages of British tabloids.<br />\n<br />\n\tAt center, there's Charles, who becomes king at the moment of his mother's death though coronation remains months away. Although he admits to having longed  for the crown for many years, the reality of his ascent is jolting, and rare minutes of solitude allow him to reflect on the future and to muse, \"I am better the thoughtful prince than king.\"<br />\n<br />\n\tACT's Charles is Canadian actor Robert Joy, whose credits run from comedy to musicals to Shakespearean drama on stage, screen and TV. In his current role, he displays a nervous, conflicted and sometimes humble man, appropriate traits all, but his total lack of gravitas undercuts the weight of the decision he must make.<br />\n<br />\n\tIn carefully chosen dramatic irony, Bartlett sets the king on a collision course with parliament over a bill that would restrict the freedom of Britain's notoriously salacious press. Considering his own experiences involving adultery during his marriage to the widely adored Princess Diana, it would come as no surprise if Charles supported limits on journalistic intrusions into private lives. But he doesn't.<br />\n<br />\n\tHis devotion to the principle of free speech and a free press trumps any personal impulse, precipitating a constitutional crisis (though Britain has no written constitution), riots and threats to dissolve the monarchy. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-24-1474678313-8915813-harrykebabs.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-09-24-1474678313-8915813-harrykebabs.jpg\" height=\"417\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-24-1474678313-8915813-harrykebabs-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<center><strong>Prince Harry (Harry Smith) discusses the state of the nation with a kebab vendor (Rafael Jordan)</strong><br />\n</center><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\tAround Joy are performers who probably come as close to real-life replicas of the royals as any ACT could find: a tall, thin, blond Prince William (Christopher McLinden), who loves and respects his father until events change their relationship; his slender, long-haired, stylish wife, Kate (Allison Jean White), as genteel as she is ambitious; a red-haired, scruffy Prince Harry (Harry Smith), who prefers boozing and wenching over royal discretion, and a robust Camilla (Jeanne Paulsen), who offers wifely advice and support to Charles.<br />\n<br />\n\tTheir performances are lucid if rarely affecting, except for White's attempt to suggest a 21st century Lady Macbeth. A pivotal role, it simply falls flat.<br />\n<br />\n\tOutside the royal circle, principals in the large cast include Ian Merrill Peakes as the Labourite prime minister, Bradford Farwell as the Conservative leader, Dan Hiatt as the manager of the king's appointments and Michelle Beck as a young woman whom Prince Harry comes to love. From this corner, Beck's relatively small role is the play's most persuasive in human terms, though the final scenes do give Joy's Charles the stature of a tragic figure, defeated by the vanities and ambitions of stronger forces.<br />\n<br />\n\tIt's impossible to predict how performances will evolve -- if at all -- over a play's run, but I have to hope they'll grow stronger. Regardless, Bartlett's tale of an  imagined future is a well-honed spur to discussion, especially in this election season.<br />\n<br />\n\t<strong><em>King Charles III</em> runs through Oct. 9 in American Conservatory Theater's Geary Theater, 415 Geary St., San Francisco.

Children endured school once again, the birds twittered merrily, and lovers everywhere fell in love.  Life went on for hundreds of millions.  Lucky them.</p><br />\n<p>In the world of wonkcraft, though, political observers everywhere are caught in a waiting game, ticking off the moments until the first presidential debate (which happens this Monday night -- which you probably already knew, if you're reading this sort of article.)  What will happen?  Will Donald Trump melt down?  Will he strain his \"presidential\" muscle?  Will he storm off the stage in a tantrum, halfway through?  Will Hillary Clinton make it through the evening without stumbling (either metaphorically or physically, one might add)?  Will Lester Holt redeem NBC News after the fiasco named Matt Lauer?  Will Trump reference body parts (his own, his opponent's, or perhaps even the moderator's)?  It's certainly happened before.</p><br />\n<p>The audience, when the debate actually happens, will be huge.  <em>Tremendous</em>, in fact.  Some (we won't say who) are even predicting it could be a bigger television event worldwide than the 1969 moon landing.  We aren't sure we'd go that far, but it certainly will be popular television, that's for sure.  But while the vast majority of Americans won't be thinking about the debate until it actually happens, the rest of us in the world of political obsession have been thinking about little else all week long.</p><br />\n<p>Hillary Clinton is spending a lot of time on debate preparation, but Team Hillary has managed to keep quiet who is \"playing Trump\" in her practice debate sessions.  Donald Trump, on the other hand, appears to be comfortable just winging it -- which, it must be admitted, worked pretty well for him in the primaries.</p><br />\n<p>Both candidates are being given conflicting advice on how tough to be.  Clinton is being told to essentially ignore Trump and just \"be presidential\" the whole time, but another faction is urging her to whip out a verbal switchblade and plunge it into her opponent.  Hey, why not?  Even the Dalai Lama's now <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dalai-lama-donald-trump-video_us_57e4ca59e4b08d73b830a1ac\">mocking Trump</a>!  Trump's natural inclination, of course, is to toss verbal hand grenades willy-nilly, but he is being urged by many Republicans to forgo the pleasure of doing so and (again) just to \"look presidential\" the whole time.  Both sides are working the media refs, and will continue to do so right up to Monday night.  Trump's team insists that if Trump just refrains from cursing (and/or being vicious), then he'll have \"won\" the night.  Clinton's team has already worked the refs to its advantage, because the spectre of Matt Lauer's fiasco will be hanging over Lester Holt in a big way.</p><br />\n<p>But no matter what happens, and no matter what is said about it afterwards, we've all still got a few days left to wait.  To fill the time, let's take a look back at the past week.</p><br />\n<p>One thing we do know for certain about Monday's debate -- there will only be two candidates on stage.  Gary Johnson and Jill Stein didn't make the official cut (of polling 15 percent or better nationally), even though this race could indeed be affected by third-party voting in a big way.</p><br />\n<p>A fun fact that few have noticed: Donald Trump hasn't given a press conference <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/21/donald-trumps-campaign-manager-has-no-clue-what-a-press-conference-is/\">in almost two months</a>.  What's up with that?  Trump used to <em>love</em> sparring with (and taunting) the press, so the absence is notable.</p><br />\n<p>Perhaps there's a reason for this, since <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-cincinnati-enquirer_us_57e55796e4b08d73b830ea6e\">yet another conservative newspaper</a> broke a <em>century-old</em> tradition by endorsing Hillary Clinton rather than the Republican candidate (as they usually do).  It's getting so this barely even qualifies as news anymore.  Trump may go down in history with the fewest newspaper endorsements ever, but (to be fair) that might not matter too much at all.</p><br />\n<p>As we were writing this, there was some breaking news on the Trump endorsement front, as Senator Ted Cruz swallowed the remaining shreds of whatever dignity he possessed, and went ahead and endorsed Donald Trump.  For handy reference, the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/23/9-truly-awful-things-that-were-said-between-ted-cruz-and-the-man-hell-now-support-donald-trump/\">put together a list</a> of just <em>some</em> of the nasty things Cruz and Trump have said about each other.  Cruz has called Trump: \"a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,\" \"a serial philanderer,\" \"utterly amoral,\" \"a bully\", and \"a sniveling coward.\"  That last one was right before he defended his wife by saying: \"Leave Heidi the hell alone.\"</p><br />\n<p>Cruz was booed at the Republican National Convention for not openly supporting Trump during his speech, after which he explained why he couldn't honor the pledge all the GOP candidates made to support the eventual nominee: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.  That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander my wife that I am going to come like a servile puppy dog for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\"  Today, servile puppy dog Ted Cruz came crawling to Trump.  It'll be interesting to see what Trump has to say about it, because back during the convention Trump had pledged, about a Cruz endorsement: \"If he gives it, I will not accept it.  I don't want his endorsement.  Just, Ted, stay home, relax, enjoy yourself.\"</p><br />\n<p>Speaking of spineless Republicans who have endorsed Trump, Chris Christie had a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/19/chris-christies-2016-just-keeps-getting-worse-and-worse-and-worse/\">pretty bad week</a>, because it came out in court that he probably <em>did</em> know all about the bridge closure while it was happening.  Whoops!  The New Jersey state congress is now reportedly <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Key-NJ-Legislators-Looking-at-Christie-Impeachment-Sources-394560041.html\">considering impeaching him</a>, which might guarantee that he'd never get to be Trump's attorney general.  To convict Christie, Democrats would need to convince three state GOP senators to vote to convict, though, so it's not a sure thing.</p><br />\n<p>One quick note from the other side of the campaign aisle (if that metaphor isn't too mixed) that few have yet noticed: Hillary Clinton seems to be <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">recovering somewhat</a> in the polls.  Now, this trend is recent and could just be statistical noise, and no matter what happens the credit or blame will likely go to her debate performance, but while most pundits are still going with \"Clinton down in the polls!\" the reality is that she's been doing better for at least a week -- while Trump's numbers have topped out and started to slide backwards.  If she does well in the debate, she'll already have a tailwind at her back, to put this another way.</p><br />\n<p>And finally, a last item unrelated to the campaign.  Not to be outdone by hating on Obamacare, a whole bunch of mostly-Republican states <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/21-states-sue-over-obama-administrations-overtime-pay-law_us_57e17e73e4b0071a6e09e3d4\">have now sued</a> the Obama administration to try to stop the new overtime rule from going into effect this December.  Obama announced the new rule a while back, which will <em>double</em> the threshold where employees can be called \"salaried\" -- thereby avoiding pesky overtime payments for their employers.  The old limit was decades old, whereas the new limit of $47,500 is much more in line with today's working reality.  As it turns out, greedy corporations aren't the only ones abusing low-paid workers by working them 50 or 60 hours a week with no extra pay -- state governments have been exploiting the same loophole!  And now they're sad, because they are going to have to stop the practice.  What was interesting was what one of the attorneys general suing predicted, should the new rule take effect: \"it may lead to disastrous consequences for our economy.\"  Um, yeah, because giving workers more money or more time to enjoy it would certainly be a disaster, right?  Yet another difference between the two parties that Democrats out on the campaign trail really should be exploiting.</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/midotwsm.jpg\" /></p><br />\n<p>This week's <strong>Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week</strong> award was pretty easy to pick, as Senator Elizabeth Warren proved once again what a bang-up choice she would have been for Hillary Clinton's veep.</p><br />\n<p>Warren excels at raking Wall Street executives over the coals in Senate hearings, of course, and this week was no different.  Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was on the hot seat this time around, for running a scam for <em>five years</em> and then \"cleaning it up\" by firing a bunch of low-level employees and giving all the executives (himself included) fat multi-million-dollar bonuses.</p><br />\n<p>Warren was scathing in her indictment not only of Stumpf, but of the culture that allows such things to happen.  She lit into him with barely-concealed disgust, saying to his face: \"You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated.\"  She had plenty of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-john-stumpf-wells-fargo_us_57e1591ee4b04a1497b6caae\">other things</a> to say, as well:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\"This just isn't right,\" Warren said. \"You squeezed employees to the breaking point\" to drive up the stock price and your compensation, she said, referencing the bank's fierce drive to \"cross-sell\" or make customers open up multiple accounts. \"You went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour\" workers.</p><br />\n<p>\"It's gutless leadership,\" Warren said.</p><br />\n<p>Last week Stumpf in a televised interview appeared to blame low-level workers for this behavior, which was widespread throughout the bank -- 5,300 employees were fired for their involvement.</p><br />\n<p>A cashier who \"steals a handful of $20s\" is held accountable, Warren said. Bank executives aren't.</p><br />\n<p>\"The only way Wall Street will change will be if executives face jail time\" for criminal behavior, she said.</p></blockquote><br />\n<p>Amen to that, sister.  Elizabeth Warren continues to be the worst scourge Wall Street has seen since Teddy Roosevelt, and she more than earned her eleventh <strong>MIDOTW</strong> award this week.  Since the veep slot is already taken, might we suggest Secretary of the Treasury Elizabeth Warren?</p><br />\n<p>[<em>Congratulate Senator Elizabeth Warren on <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=email_senator\">her Senate contact page</a>, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.</em>]</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/mddotwsm.jpg\" /></p><br />\n<p>For the second time inside the same month, our obvious winner of the <strong>Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week</strong> award is none other than serial peter-tweeter Anthony \"Most Appropriate Last Name Ever\" Weiner.</p><br />\n<p>This one may be a whole lot more serious than <em>all the other times</em> he got caught \"sexting\" with women who were not currently married to him.  Because this time, Weiner was reportedly committing digital hanky-panky with a <em>15-year-old girl</em>.  Wow.  We really thought he had <em>already</em> hit the lowest part of the gutter, but it turns out he has sunk even further into the slime down there.  So far into the slime that he is now facing a criminal investigation, because getting raunchy with underage high school students online is actually <em>against the law</em> (which wasn't true for all his other exploits with adult women).</p><br />\n<p>In fact, we can't even bring ourselves to rake through the sordid details, so we'll just provide one link to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/22/inquiry-launched-into-anthony-weiners-alleged-suggestive-online-messages-with-teen/?utm_term=.0305b4238e26\">an overview story</a> with nothing but the broad details, as well as a link to the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html\">original story</a>, which comes complete with all the naughty texts and the eyebrow-raising details (which include rape fantasies and an actual schoolgirl dressing up like a schoolgirl).  Choose which link to read, based on the strength of your intestinal fortitude, we suppose.</p><br />\n<p>One thing that didn't give us a moment's pause, however, was to hand Anthony Weiner his sixth <strong>Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week</strong> -- all given out for his amorous online behavior.  Four weeks ago, when we gave him his fifth award, we wrote: \"Hopefully, three strikes means he will forever be out of the public eye, and we'll never have to give him another <strong>MDDOTW</strong> award ever again. Hopefully, at any rate.\"</p><br />\n<p>Our hopes, as it turned out, were dashed -- within a single month's time.</p><br />\n<p>[<em>We do not provide people's contact info who are not currently in public office as a rule, but as it turns out it appears you can send Anthony Weiner a text message quite easily.

Yes, we speak of the Beach Boys, and the <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beachboys/409.html\">immortal lines</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p><em>She's real fine, my 409<br />She's real fine, my 409<br />My 4... 0... 9</em></p></blockquote><br />\n<p>These were simpler times, back when a band could include a line like: \"My four-speed dual-quad Posi-Traction 409\" and everyone knew what they were talking about (without having to have Marisa Tomei explain it in <em>My Cousin Vinny</em>, either).  Good times, indeed.  Seriously, given the choice between that and the brand name of a household cleaner, we'll choose the Beach Boys every time.  Truer words were never spoken: \"Giddy up, giddy up, 409.\"</p><br />\n<p>Ahem.  Where were we?  Oh, right, politics.  Somehow we got distracted there for a moment.  We do apologize, it won't happen again.</p><br />\n<p>The business at hand is, of course, attempting to create some zingers for Hillary Clinton to use in Monday's debate.  We tried to pick just the things that will really get under Trump's orange skin.  He's awfully touchy about certain subjects, so if the moderator isn't hitting them hard enough, Clinton should step in and do so herself.  Given the fact that she'll have a couple of minutes for each response, the talking points came out longer than normal this week.  But if Clinton even says anything close to <em>any</em> of them, we'll be happy enough.</p><br />\n<p>Trump is pretty easy to bait, and if he hasn't melted down by (say) halfway through, then Clinton should start needling him to provoke the \"Mr. Hyde\" version of Trump millions of people will be tuning in to see.  So here are our seven suggestions to be included in Hillary's debate prep sessions.</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt=\"1\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/1.jpg\" /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hands?</strong><br clear=\"all\" /></p><br />\n<p>No, that's not a lead-in to a \"tiny hands\" joke.  Sure, it'd be amusing if Hillary went there, but we seriously doubt she will.  Instead, it's an answer to a riff Trump let loose earlier this week.</p><br />\n<p>\"Donald, you said earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/21/9-reasons-to-be-skeptical-of-donald-trumps-comment-about-american-hands/\">and I quote</a>: American hands will rebuild our nation, not the hands of people from other nations.  Unquote.  I find this a little laughable, because it's a well-known fact that Trump Tower was built using Polish laborers, some of whom were illegal immigrants at the time.  Your new D.C. hotel was built with lots of Central American construction workers, also including some undocumented immigrants.  Down in Mar-a-Lago, you import foreign workers every summer rather than hire American workers who according to you should have jobs made available to them before any foreigners are even considered.  And don't even get me started on all the products -- your signature ties, your suits -- which are made in China and elsewhere overseas.  So why should anyone believe you when you say you'll make sure 'American hands' are put to work?  After all, you certainly have never operated any of your own business that way.\"</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt=\"2\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/2.jpg\" /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever?

'Ever, ever, ever.'  <em>Really?</em>  Can you not even think of <em>one single period</em> of American history where African-American communities were in worse shape?  Not even one?  Do any of these words mean anything to you at all?  Jim Crow.  Segregation.  Slavery.  Lynchings.  Race riots.  Dred Scott.  Separate but equal.  Any of these ringing a bell?

You <em>say</em> you're worth billions -- but you won't let anyone look at your taxes.  You <em>say</em> you give millions to charity, but won't prove it in any way.  You <em>say</em> you hate all the influence-buying in politics, but it turns out your campaign is handing millions of dollars that other people have donated to you over <em>to your own businesses</em> -- seven percent of all the money you've recently spent went to your own businesses.  Now, I've released decades of my tax returns so the public can see how much I give to charity, how much money I make, and where it comes from.  You refuse to do the same.  You <em>say</em> you're under audit, but you won't even release older tax returns which are <em>not covered by the audit</em>.  Why won't you show the public your tax returns for 2006?  Or 2005?  Or 2001?  Or any year before that?  What do you have to hide?  What are you scared the public will figure out?  That you're nowhere near as wealthy as you pretend to be?  That you don't pay any taxes at all?  I'll even make it easy for you, so you can keep your big secret hidden in every tax return you've ever filed -- just answer me one simple question: how much money did <em>you personally</em> donate to charity last year?  How much?  Just a ballpark figure -- that won't affect your audit in any way, shape, or form.  So how much did you give last year, Donald -- out of your <em>own pocket</em>?    It's a pretty easy question, after all.\"</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt=\"4\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/4.jpg\" /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracks in the foundation</strong><br clear=\"all\" /></p><br />\n<p>Clinton, of course, will be asked about her family foundation.  After answering the question, she should demand equal time from Trump.</p><br />\n<p>\"The Clinton Foundation has consistently earned the highest ratings from independent organizations who carefully examine non-profit records.  We just earned four stars out of four, as a matter of fact.  Meanwhile, the Donald J. Trump foundation has been operated like a personal slush fund by Mr. Trump.  He hasn't donated one thin dime to his namesake foundation in over six years, which is rather astonishing.  The Trump Foundation just got caught giving a political donation to an attorney general who was thinking about filing charges against the Trump University scam.  That's illegal, and led to a fine from the I.R.S.  But there's plenty of other questionable activities the Trump Foundation has been caught doing -- like spending tens of thousands of dollars on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/21/how-a-univision-anchor-found-the-missing-10000-portrait-that-trump-bought-with-his-charitys-money/\">paintings of Donald Trump</a> that were then hung in his for-profit businesses.  That's illegal, too.  The Trump Foundation has even been exposed for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\">paying off</a> Donald Trump's personal legal obligations, in court, to the tune of over a quarter-million dollars.  Donald, you stiffed a guy who thought he had won a million bucks by hitting a hole-in-one -- since you promised this amount during the tournament -- and then after he had to sue you, you paid the man off by donating to his charity from your own charity, instead of out of your own pocket like you should have.  Which is, once again, illegal.  My charity does good work all over the globe.  Yours seems to be nothing more than a cookie jar for you to dip into whenever you feel like.\"</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt=\"5\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/5.jpg\" /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show me the money!</strong><br clear=\"all\" /></p><br />\n<p>I considering going with \"Where's the beef?\" but that's even staler than <em>Jerry Maguire</em>.</p><br />\n<p>\"You know, Donald, I hear a whole lot of ideas from you about what you're going to do as president.  You make all kinds of promises, but the one thing that you won't admit is that all the things you say you're going to do -- walls, deportations, stuff like that -- cost money.  And you never seem to get around to saying how you're going to pay for any of it.  Your plans would add trillions of dollars to the national debt, something you say you disapprove of.  When I propose a plan, I say how I'm going to pay for it.  You don't.  Plain and simple.  What are you going to do if you actually do pass some of these things into law, and it blows a trillion-dollar hole in the budget?  In the real world, things have to be paid for.  I know this might be a foreign concept to you, since you're used to stiffing people who work for you and daring them to sue you if they want more than pennies on the dollar of what you promised you'd pay them, and you're also used to just declaring one of your companies bankrupt and walking away from all your debt, but the government doesn't work that way.  So I ask you, Donald, for all of these supposedly-wonderful things you're promising you'll do: Where's the money going to come from?  Show me the money!\"</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt=\"6\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/6.jpg\" /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of millions?</strong><br clear=\"all\" /></p><br />\n<p>Getting back to those tax returns....</p><br />\n<p>\"Why should America trust Donald Trump to set our foreign policy when he won't even tell us how much he owes foreign banks?  Rumor has it that Trump has a tough time getting American banks to lend him any money anymore, because he's stiffed them so many times in his convenient bankruptcies.  They've learned their lesson -- lending money to Trump is a bad bet.  So he had to go overseas to get funding.  He finally found some banks in China and Russia that would lend him money, and now I've seen estimates that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to banks in <em>both</em> countries.  So again, because you have such a big secret in your tax returns that we aren't even going to get a chance to see them, let me ask you point-blank: How much money do you owe Chinese and Russian bankers, Donald?  It's an easy question, and one that anyone auditioning for commander-in-chief needs to clearly answer.  Because you'd better believe that's going to influence our entire country's foreign policy if Donald Trump is elected.\"</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt=\"7\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/7.jpg\" /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C'mon, you can say it!</strong><br clear=\"all\" /></p><br />\n<p>Perhaps it's all the talk of \"Where's the beef?\" and Beach Boys songs, but I couldn't resist the urge to reach way back for this one.  Those who recognize it will immediately get the joke.  Those who don't, ask someone over the age of 45 to explain it to you.</p><br />\n<p>\"Can you even say the words 'I was wrong,' Donald?  Is it even physically possible for you to utter that phrase?  So far, there's been no evidence of it.  You spent how many years stating Barack Obama was hiding something in his birth certificate, or was perhaps born elsewhere.  Then, last week, I guess your political handlers and donors made you dance like a puppet on a string and admit that Barack Obama was indeed born in Hawai'i, just like he had been saying all along.  So, he was right.  You were wrong.  Man up, Donald.  Admit it.  Just say the words 'I was wrong' once, to prove you can.  Otherwise, we'll all just have to believe you've got the same speech impediment that so famously afflicted the Fonz.\"</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Chris Weigant blogs at:</em></p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/2016/09/23/ftp409/\" title=\"ChrisWeigant.com\"><img alt=\"ChrisWeigant.com\" height=\"29\" src=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/cw/wp-content/themes/crispy2/pix/cwlogo.jpg\" width=\"160\" /></a></p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Follow Chris on Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/ChrisWeigant\">@ChrisWeigant</a></p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Full archives of FTP columns: </em><a href=\"http://www.fridaytalkingpoints.com\">FridayTalkingPoints.com</a></p><br />\n<p align=\"center\"><em>All-time award winners leaderboard, </em><a href=\"http://www.chrisweigant.com/ftpts/ftpawards/\">by rank</a></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "Friday Talking Points -- The Debate Wait", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/friday-talking-points_b_12161810.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 13, "description": "<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-24-1474675494-2279419-makeamericasmartagain.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-09-24-1474675494-2279419-makeamericasmartagain.jpg\" height=\"570\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-24-1474675494-2279419-makeamericasmartagain-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" /></a></center><br />\n<br />\nThe #MakeAmericaSmartAgain movement is growing and you can get in on the action.  A lot is on the line come November 9th.  It is no surprise that Mike Judge's cult film <i>Idiocracy</i> is more relevant than ever.  I recently had the opportunity to chat with Sharon and Jeff Sperber.  The married couple are behind Eat|See|Hear--a premier LA outdoor movie, food truck and live music event company.  They explained why the upcoming 10th anniversary screening of  <i>Idiocracy</i> on September 24th resonates with the American public.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Hey guys!  Thanks for the interview.  Can you explain the creative process of the 'Make America Smart Again' campaign?</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Jeff Sperber:</b> Shepard's Studio One team approached us about doing a special event screening of <i>Idiocracy</i> at the end of our summer season to support the 'Make America Smart Again' campaign.  As fans of Shepard, <i>Idiocracy</i> and supporters of the cause we were excited to craft this very special outdoor event. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Very cool.  Why do you think is it important for young people to register to vote?</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Sharon Sperber:</b> Too many young people don't understand why voting is important.  Education about the issues is key.  Only you know what is important to you and it's critical that younger (and older) people know what's at stake, what the key issues and causes are, where each candidate stands and most importantly, no one is perfect.  It's rare that you are going to align your personal views 100% with a candidate.  You have to know what is most important to you and that your candidate of choice aligns on those issues.  It's a very grey area.<br />\n<br />\n<b>I completely agree.  How did you get Mike Judge, Dax Shepard and Terry Crews involved with the event?</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Jeff Sperber:</b>  Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell have been out to a few Eat|See|Hear events in the past, so we reached out to see if he'd be willing to join us.  The #MASA team had been in contact with Terry very early on and we're thrilled that Mike Judge was available to make this a great reunion<br />\n<br />\n<b>What is the Library Foundation of LA?  Why do you feel strongly about this particular organization?</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Jeff Sperber:</b>  The Library Foundation of Los Angeles provides critical support to the Los Angeles Public Library resulting in free programs, resources, and services available to the millions of adults, children and youth in Los Angeles.  Through fundraising, advocacy and innovative programs, the Library Foundation strengthens the Los Angeles Public Library and promotes greater awareness of its valuable resources.<br />\n<br />\n<b>That's amazing.  Education is so important.  Before I let you guys go, I have to ask...What do you see for the future of America?</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Sharon Sperber:</b>  If I could predict the future I would have won Powerball already.  What we are sure of is that on November 9th, regardless of who is elected President, we will still be living in a nation with glaring systemic problems that must be improved.  Hopefully we will as a nation find our way back to where compromise and pragmatism are more important than ideology and outrage.<br />\n<br />\nYou can purchase tickets to the 10th anniversary screening of <i>Idiocracy</i> in LA by clicking <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eat-see-hear-outdoor-movie-idiocracy-tickets-27102551461\" target=\"_hplink\">here</a>. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "Eat|See|Hear Presents the 10th Anniversary Screening of Idiocracy", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kyle-stevens/eatseehear-presents-the-1_b_12159358.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 14, "description": "<br />\n<p>Texas on Friday asked the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/supreme-court/\">Supreme Court</a> to take a long, hard look at its voter ID law ― weakened after legal challenges stripped it of much of its teeth.</p><br />\n<p>State officials filed a formal appeal asking justices to review a July ruling that found the law <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-voter-id-struck-down_us_578fc842e4b0bdddc4d2c785\">had a discriminatory effect on minority voters</a> and thus violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p><br />\n<p>The move, for now, is only symbolic.
