Visiting him there is a vertiginous experience. For one thing, he works – and likes to entertain visitors – in what he calls his “writing tower”, a flimsy-seeming, glass-walled turret perched right on the very edge of the roof. (Look down, if you dare, and you will see his little boat moored far below.) For another, there is the fact that from this vantage point it is possible to discern two Berlins, one thrusting and breezy, the other spectral and grey. To our left, busy with traffic, is the Oberbaum Bridge, where there was once a cold war checkpoint, and beyond it the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall, its doleful length rudely interrupted by the block of luxury flats that went up in 2013. As for the large building immediately opposite, these days it’s the home of Universal Music. Not so very long ago, however, it was the GDR’s egg storage facility.</p><p>Does all this press on Ohler as he sits at his desk, the light bouncing off the screen of his laptop? Is it ghostly sometimes? “Yes, it is strange,” he says, smiling at my giddiness. But then he has long believed in a certain kind of time travel. “I remember the 90s. The wall had just come down, and I was experimenting with party drugs like ecstasy and LSD. The techno scene had started up, and there were all these empty buildings in the east where the youth [from east and west] would meet for the first time. They were hardcore, some of those guys from the east – they didn’t understand foreigners at all – and the ecstasy helped them to lose some of their hatred and suspicion. Sometimes, then, you could step into a room, and you could just <em>see</em> the past. Of course, it’s not like that now. I don’t take drugs any more. But I can remember it, and maybe that was why I was able to write this book.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/25/blitzed-norman-ohler-adolf-hitler-nazi-drug-abuse-interview\">Continue reading...</a>", "title": "High Hitler: how Nazi drug abuse steered the course of history", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/25/blitzed-norman-ohler-adolf-hitler-nazi-drug-abuse-interview", "source": "World news | The Guardian", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 36, "description": "<p>Martin Baker Aircraft Ltd facing charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act after death of Sean Cunningham in 2011</p><p>An ejector seat manufacturer is to prosecuted over the death of a Red Arrows pilot at RAF Scampton in 2011. </p><p>The Health and Safety Executive said it would be prosecuting Martin Baker Aircraft Ltd for an alleged breach of health and safety law.

In the years since then, the level of incivility in our political life, as evidenced by the current Presidential campaign, has only gotten worse. I sought to reassure my student, and to do so not with platitudes but with examples. I chose two.<br />\n <br />\nIn 1973, Congress enacted and ultimately passed over a presidential veto, the War Powers Act, one of the most significant pieces of legislation in American history concerning the separation of powers and United States foreign policy. The law limited presidential power to commit American armed forces without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. The president at the time, Richard Nixon, was a Republican; Democrats were in the majority of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. But the bill received bipartisan support and, perhaps most remarkable of all, one of the prime architects of the legislation was Senator Jacob Javits, a Republican from New York. The fact that Javits was from the minority party of the Senate and of the same party as the president did not keep him from playing a leadership role in a piece of legislation that restricted the president's powers and elevated those of Congress.<br />\n <br />\nI also shared with my student a lesser known story told to me by one of my board members when I was a law school dean. This story took place in the 1960s -- once again, Democrats controlled the House and the Senate. This board member, while a student at George Washington University Law School, had worked on Capitol Hill as an aide to a Republican congressman. He delighted in telling the story of the instrumental role he was able to play in legislation protecting consumers of mobile homes. The most remarkable part of this story: at the time, it did not strike him as surprising or even noteworthy that a Republican congressman could play a leadership role in enacting legislation in a Democratically-controlled Congress.<br />\n <br />\n\"No,\" I told my student. \"It has not always been like this.\" Is it possible to reverse the trend toward incivility in our political life and to restore some basis of cooperation, collaboration and dialog? And how might we, as citizens, play a role in this? We should look to the wisdom of Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan, a 19th- and early 20th-century teacher, scholar and ethicist in Eastern Europe, whose most famous work, \"Guarding the Tongue,\" explicated Jewish laws and learning concerning speech, the power of words, and especially the danger of gossip and malicious speech. His teachings, as powerful and direct today as they were when written more than 125 years ago, are strikingly simple to articulate and deceptively difficult to implement -- we should watch our words carefully, weighing them as we would our treasures. We should speak, discuss, even argue and debate decently and respectfully of others, questioning their ideas but not their motives.<br />\n <br />\nThis Rabbi's teachings apply to us on the national and political level, and on the local and personal level as well. There are those in their political discourse who have condemned entire races or nationalities or ethnic groups. There are those in their personal discourse who disparage neighbors and colleagues, becoming \"frenemies\" or worse yet, bullies. Guarding our tongue is a message for national debates, for the workplace, and for the kitchen table.<br />\n <br />\nThe anniversary of the passing of the Rabbi Israel Meir Kagen occurs on Sept. 27. On that day, a group called Acheinu is asking all Americans to refrain from gossip and harmful speech. Just for one day. It is a small but significant gesture. Is it possible that if we could do so as a society for one day, we might be able to do it for another, and then another? This is something that, as seemingly unattainable as it sounds, is utterly within our control. Ronald Reagan once said, \"I've always believed that a lot of the trouble in the world would disappear if we were talking to each other instead of about each other.\" And as Robert F. Kennedy said in Indianapolis, on the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,<br />\n <br />\n\"What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another.... Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.\" <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "Disagreeing Agreeably: Dedicating Ourselves to Productive Dialog", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frederick-m-lawrence/disagreeing-agreeably-ded_b_12142910.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 3, "description": "Don't let the summer's end get you down.

She is committed to writing new economic rules that will put us on the path to shared prosperity. She is calling for a new direction on trade. She is proposing the most substantial investment in infrastructure since the interstate highway system, generating over 10 million new jobs. She wants bigger paychecks, paid time off, a fair schedule and the right to join a union for every single worker.  <br />\n<br />\nHillary is the only reasonable, responsible, civil and moral candidate who will be on that stage at Hofstra University. But being better than Donald Trump is the lowest of bars. It is not enough. Millions of Americans are wondering if they'll ever get to experience the American Dream, and they are hungry for leaders who will never stop fighting for them.<br />\n<br />\nBut in the end, voters elect people, not just agendas. In this first debate, Hillary Clinton must show America her core: a compassionate, brilliant, forceful advocate for progress.<br />\n<br />\nThis is the Hillary Clinton I know. The woman who is driven by the same impulses today as she was 40 years ago, the hunger to steer America toward the progressive nature of our national character. A person of determination who spends every day thinking about ways to help others.<br />\n<br />\nAmericans have not seen enough of that Hillary. Partly, she has not let them, and partly, the tumultuous nature of our politics has overshadowed her true character.<br />\n<br />\nMany Americans are angry and frustrated. Who can blame them? They are working harder than ever only to see their standard of living decline or grind to a halt. Those struggling to get by see Washington as increasingly out of touch, self-serving and more interested in conflict than compromise. So any politician with decades of service and a famous last name is going to be met with understandable skepticism. <br />\n<br />\nHillary Clinton acknowledges that when it comes to public service, the \"service\" part has always been easier for her than the \"public\" part. She has been scrutinized as much as any figure in American history. As the first woman to lead a major-party ticket, a double standard is often applied to her. She has a tendency to be guarded. Accumulating layers over four decades in politics can invite further doubt. <br />\n<br />\nSo Hillary needs to let America see the person who would lead them. In this debate, she should showcase the woman who marched on picket lines with workers, spent time and energy helping first responders after 9-11, and is one of the best listeners I have ever met. <br />\n<br />\nThat means trusting her convictions and expressing them from the heart. Remember, Hillary has never been on a November presidential ballot before. And she has never stood 50 feet from Donald Trump, with just a moderator in between.

He now proposes a massive increase in military spending. And instead of making the military more efficient by cutting Pentagon waste, Trump will \"fully offset\" the increase in military spending by reducing spending on non-defense programs through reducing their \"government waste and budget gimmicks.\"<br />\n<br />\nFor an idea of what that might entail for non-defense spending, consider the Republican budget blueprint passed by the House in early 2015 (no Democrat voted in favor). To offset a significant increase in military spending, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/us/politics/increased-military-spending-wins-out-after-dueling-budget-votes-in-house.html?_r=0\">reports</a>, Medicaid would be cut by $900 billion. Spending on the food stamp program would be shrunk by hundreds of billions of dollars. Spending for Pell Grants for college, job training and housing assistance would be slashed.<br />\n<br />\nThe 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) stopped the Republicans from achieving their guns-not-butter budgetary. The BCA emerged from a confluence of events: A soaring deficit, the result of extensive federal spending that stopped a major economic recession from becoming a major economic depression and the Republican takeover of the House after the 2010 election. The result was a dramatic near government shut down showdown on how to cut the deficit.<br />\n<br />\nThe White House and Congress couldn't agree. The BCA was a bludgeon, a crude across-the-board spending mandate intended to spur Congress and the White House to negotiate a more thoughtful approach. They couldn't. As a consequence, in 2013 there was an immediate $110 billion cut in spending, divided more or less equally from defense and non-defense programs. Defense spending comprises about 54 percent of the discretionary budget, that part of the federal budget over which Congress has direct control through annual appropriations. Congress also imposed caps on defense and non-defense spending through 2021.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the cuts were supposedly proportional, the pain inflicted was not. Real per-capita funding for non-defense programs have <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/blog/even-without-sequestration-non-defense-spending-still-headed-toward-historic-low\">fallen</a> more than 10 percent below 2010 levels while the population served and the demand for services grew. The Veterans Administration, considered non-defense spending, has been swamped by increased demand from older Vietnam War veterans and a new influx from Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. Rising rents and stagnant incomes have led to an increased demand for rental assistance even while the total number of families receiving assistance has fallen.<br />\n<br />\nThe injury to the Pentagon was far more modest. Troop levels declined, but that was to be expected given that two major wars were winding down. The Navy and Air Force got fewer new ships and aircraft than they wanted. Base construction slowed.<br />\n<br />\nThe Pentagon also suffered less because it was able to tap into another source of funding: The Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) reserve <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44519.pdf\">established</a> to give the Pentagon immediate flexibility in war spending. Originally the OCO was subject to budget caps but in 2011, the same year caps were enacted, Congress exempted OCO spending, expanded the fund and began tapping it for non war-related Pentagon spending.<br />\n<br />\nSince 2013, Republicans and Democrats have battled over the caps. Each time, at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour they've agreed to increase them equally for both military and non-military spending, most recently in late 2015 after President Obama vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act that would have raised military but not non-military spending.<br />\n<br />\nDonald Trump proposes to eliminate the caps on military spending and reimburse DOD tens of billions of dollars it lost from past cuts. Increased military spending will be offset by decreasing non-defense spending through improving program efficiency and reducing waste. But the evidence is overwhelming that the inefficiencies and waste fall most heavily on the military side.<br />\n<br />\nConsider that in 1994, the Government Management Reform Act required the Inspector General of each federal agency to audit and publish the financial statements of their agency. All Non-Defense agencies complied. The Department of Defense did not.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-war-on-waste/\">confessed</a>, \"we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.\" In June 2016, Pentagon's Inspector General <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-audit-army-idUSKCN10U1IG\">criticized</a> the US Army for misreporting $6.5 trillion (yes, trillion with a T) for the 2015 fiscal year. \"(I)nserting phony numbers\" is how Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-waste-specialreport-idUSBRE9AH0LQ20131118\">describes</a> the Pentagon's strategy for balancing the books.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2009 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09468.pdf\">reported</a> on audit quality and independence issues at the Pentagon's Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the federal watchdog responsible for auditing oversight of military contractors. One Pentagon auditor admitted he did not perform detailed tests because, \"The contractor would not appreciate it.\"   That statement makes no sense unless you understand the intimate relationship between the Pentagon and its contractors. From 2004 to 2008, 80 percent of retiring three and four star officers went to work as consultants or defense executives.<br />\n<br />\n\"In almost any other realm it would seem a clear conflict of interest. But this is the Pentagon where...such apparent conflicts are a routine fact of life\", an in-depth investigation by the Boston Globe <u>concluded</u>.<br />\n<br />\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes criminal penalties on corporate managers who certify false financial reports. But, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-waste-specialreport-idUSBRE9AH0LQ20131118\">according</a> to Mike Young, a former Air Force logistics officer, \"The concept of Sarbanes-Oxley is completely foreign\" to the Pentagon.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) the Pentagon so far has <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/defense-budget/2016/will-the-pentagon-ever-be.html\">spent</a> roughly $6 billion on \"fixing\" the audit problem without success. (<a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/\">POGO</a> is by far the best resource for information related to military spending.)<br />\n<br />\nI doubt there's a real sense of urgency. The military knows that if it misses the next congressionally mandated deadline there will be no consequences. In 2012 Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA) introduced a bill <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6528\">Audit the Pentagon</a> that would reduce by 5 percent the budget of any federal agency without an unqualified audit opinion by an external, independent auditor. The bill did not receive a hearing. In 2014 and 2015 she reintroduced the bill but reduced the penalty to a 0.5 percent budget reduction. Still there were no hearings.<br />\n<br />\nFor <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/articles/2016-02-03/the-pentagon-could-reach-a-historic-level-of-wasteful-spending\">William Hartung</a>, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy we are living in \"a golden age for Pentagon waste\". A recent Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-waste-specialreport-idUSBRE9AH0LQ20131118\">investigation</a> by Scot J. Paltrow sums up the shocking mess. The Pentagon is \"largely incapable of keeping track of its vast stores of weapons, ammunition and other supplies; thus it continues to spend money on new supplies it doesn't need and on storing others long out of date. It has amassed a backlog of more than half a trillion dollars in unaudited contracts with outside vendors; how much of that money paid for actual goods and services delivered isn't known. And it repeatedly falls prey to fraud and theft that can go undiscovered for years, often eventually detected by external law enforcement agencies.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhen outside agencies have been able to gather data they've discovered rampant fraud. Records show that the <a href=\"http://www.corp-research.org/raytheon\">Raytheon Company</a> defrauded the Pentagon 5 times up until 2003. <a href=\"http://www.corp-research.org/lockheed-martin\">Lockheed Martin</a> 7 times as of 2013, <a href=\"http://www.corp-research.org/northrop-grumman\">Northrup Grumman</a> 7 times as of 2010. They continued to receive huge Pentagon contracts.<br />\n<br />\nWhat could be more vulgar than corruption disguised as patriotism?<br />\n<br />\nJon Basil Utley, publisher of <em>The American Conservative</em> <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/16-ways-to-cut-defense-spending-7/\">describes</a> the sorry process by which the Pentagon develops weapons.<br />\n<blockquote>Weapons are designed to be built in key congressional districts, not to be the most efficient or cost effective.... The F-22 had 1,000 suppliers in 44 states. The F-35 has 1,300 suppliers in 45 states in key congressional districts and is now estimated to cost up to $300 million per plane. Weapons manufacturing is started before finalized testing so as to build a constituency for programs' continuation. Military contractors then get cost-plus contracts to modify the weapons, which won't work properly because insufficient initial testing was done before manufacturing them.</blockquote><br />\nGiven this dysfunctional and self-serving process, it should come as no surprise that the GAO <u>found</u> \"staggering\" cost overruns of almost $300 billion in nearly 70 percent of the Pentagon's 96 major weapons.<br />\n<br />\nIn the 1960s, Pentagon whistleblower Ernest Fitzgerald exposed $2 billion in cost overruns on Lockheed's C-5A transport aircraft. It was considered a scandal. Today's F-35 fighter plane already has posted cost overruns of $500 billion and more is to come. The F-35 has yet to prove itself battle-ready, and may never be. Nevertheless, earlier this year Congress added and the President signed off on 11 additional F-35's to DOD appropriations.<br />\n<br />\nWastefulness is not the hallmark only of weapons procurement. Personnel costs are also wildly excessive. The Pentagon is top heavy with officers and generals paid vastly more than civilians with the same skills and education. Most of these officers work in public affairs or procurement or financial management or other jobs that do not require an officer.<br />\n<br />\nThe Pentagon currently has over 640,000 private contractors. No one knows the exact number but this is almost certainly an underestimate. They work alongside 800,000 civilian employees. A Rand Corporation report <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/OP240.html\">concluded</a> contracting out is 25 percent more expensive than if performed by government employees. One Congressional study <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/OP240.html\">found</a> that such contracts are on average, twice as expansive as in-house work. Some 70 percent of federal spending on intelligence is on private contracts. (Think Edward Snowden).<br />\n<br />\nPOGO <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2015/10/08/pentagon-needs-to-cut-shadow-contractor-work-force\">estimates</a> the Pentagon could save more than $20 billion a year if it reduced just its contractor work force by 15 percent.<br />\n<br />\nWalter Pincus writes in the <em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/19/AR2006031900978_pf.html\">Washington Post</a></em> about the inherent inefficiencies of contracting out. \"The government pays to get the worker qualified, then ends up leasing back . . . former employees.\"<br />\n<br />\nThere is another danger in contracting out. As a 2014 GAO <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/667059.pdf\">report</a> warns, \"Without a thorough review of contractor activities, DOD risks becoming overly reliant on contractors to support core missions.\"<br />\n<br />\nMajor Kevin P. Stiens and Lt. Colonel (Ret.) Susan L. Turley have <a href=\"https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=65+A.F.+L.+Rev.+145&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=bf73240d21a5e31cc3617bb13382efc4\">observed</a>, \"The government lost personnel experience and continuity, along with operational control, by moving to contractors.\" Air Force Colonel Steven Zamperelli <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=IOQjNuxMrOEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=Private+employees+have+distinctly+different+motivations,+responsibilities+and+loyalties+than+those+in+the+public+military&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ShB2lJMXce&amp;sig=IPcO2E2bLl_aVYPtuiGU24YvMW0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgj_-MnqHPAhVK44MKHZtMDVUQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Private%20employees%20have%20distinctly%20different%20motivations%2C%20responsibilities%20and%20loyalties%20than%20those%20in%20the%20public%20military&amp;f=false\">adds</a>, \"Private employees have distinctly different motivations, responsibilities and loyalties than those in the public military.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn 2008, in an infamous <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/soldier.electrocutions/index.html?iref=allsearch\">incident</a> starkly revealed the flaws in private contracting. At least 12 U.S. soldiers were accidentally electrocuted inside their bases in Iraq. Later it was discovered the private contractor knew there were potentially serious electrical problems in the facility's construction, but its contract didn't cover \"fixing potential hazards.\" It only required repairing items already broken!<br />\n<br />\nWhile politicians refuse to penalize the DOD for not cleaning up its act, many are more than willing to demand accountability for every penny spent on non-defense programs, especially those helping the poor. In March 2014 Virginia House GOP leaders demanded the state's Medicaid program undergo a two-year external audit <u>before</u> expanding it. More than 60 audits had already been performed. In 2013 the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform did a detailed <a href=\"https://www.openminds.com/wp-content/uploads/indres/030513housecogrrptnymedicaid.pdf\">analysis</a> of New York State's Medicaid program because, \"Each dollar misspent on Medicaid is one less dollar for the country to use for better health care for the poor, education, infrastructure, national defense, deficit reduction, or any other priority.\" To date the Committee has yet to do any such analysis of Pentagon spending.<br />\n<br />\nFacing up to and correcting the wastefulness and corruption in the military budget could go a long way toward meeting the rising demands on the non-military, aka, the \"butter\" side of our national ledger.

Create lounge areas, play music to keep the office less static, and paint murals or have art around the office to inspire creativity.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>An Arcade: </strong>Who doesn't love a great arcade game? They're fun to have in the office for your team and visiting clients. Typically a two-player game arcade is the way to go, as employees can team up to win or play against each other in some friendly competition.<strong> </strong>Arcade games come in a range of budgets; there are also companies that will lease them to you for a small monthly fee.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>Catered Lunches: </strong>Catering lunch is a great way to add to the value of your company culture. I've found catering lunch leads to higher productivity, because fewer people leave to grab a bite. It also promotes being social in the office. Whether you cater once every few weeks or every day, eating is a necessity and your team will thank you for it.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>Gym Passes: </strong>With low monthly costs and gyms becoming more abundant, fitness can become a fantastic company perk.<strong> </strong>While not all employees enjoy the same exercises, new services that provide access to multiple gyms (like <a href=\"https://getlymber.com/\">Lymber</a> and <a href=\"https://classpass.com/\">ClassPass</a>) can make sure one-size membership fits all. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/\">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>, exercise keeps people less prone to illness, which cuts down on sick days that can affect the bottom line.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>Unlimited PTO: </strong>You may think offering unlimited paid time off (PTO) is out of the question. The Society for Resource Management points out there are pros and cons to this policy, but less than <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/Pages/Unlimited-PTO.aspx\">1 percent of organizations</a> have taken advantage of this perk for their employees. I've had unlimited PTO available for a few years now and can personally attest to team members usually taking less time off than in a more traditional two-weeks-per-year model. Employees have said the policy shows we trust them and offers up more autonomy in the workplace.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>Work-From-Home Days: </strong>While not for every business, work-from-home days are becoming increasingly popular. I've seen companies leverage this perk to cut down on parking costs in metropolitan areas for their employees and create more room in already full office space. With account management software like <a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a> to internal communication software like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, collaboration can expand outside the office space.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>A Student Loan Repayment Program: </strong>Student loan debt is ballooning out of control in the U.S. Creating a program that helps pay back some of your employee's student loans can help reduce stress, increase loyalty by reducing the burden of the debt, and help chip away at one of America's largest debt crises. Creating a student loan repayment program is not a one-size-fits-all company perk. It is up to the company to decide when to offer this incentive, and how much to pay back.</li><br />\n \t<li><strong>Speakers and Learning Opportunities: </strong>I've found learning to be one of the largest incentives for employees. Having a culture of learning is not just great for the team, but substantial for the company. Bringing in speakers who can elevate employee skill sets and discuss subjects like personal finance strategy will build value. We have hosted everyone from improv teachers to the co-founder of the action sports apparel company Volcom discussing building a brand. Sites that teach skills for personal development like <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\">Udemy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lynda.com/\">Lynda.com</a> are other great options.</li><br />\n<br />\nCulture is the thread that ties all companies together. Each company's culture is unique, and not all the recommendations above are going to be a fit. Try new things and add new perks, but don't be afraid of some ideas failing. After all, isn't it time we moved past wacky-tacky tie day?<br />\n<br />\n<em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickslettengren\">Nicholas Bjorn Slettengren</a> is as an entrepreneur by trade and digital marketer by evolution, with over eight years of professional agency experience he has gained a national and global perspective on the evolving digital world and is a Founder at <a href=\"http://powerdigitalmarketing.com/\">Power Digital</a>. </em> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "8 Perks to Elevate Your Company's Culture", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/young-entrepreneur-council/8-perks-to-elevate-your-c_b_12121732.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 10, "description": "<p>Well, it&rsquo;s official: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/prince-george/\">Prince George</a> is, in fact, a normal three-year-old boy.

Most college students have one small window to see a presidential debate on their campus; if their school is not selected (and only four traditionally are), then they usually graduate before the next election cycle. This debate will be Hofstra's third (it previously hosted debates in 2008 and 2012, and is the only school to host three consecutive presidential debates), and each time, students have immersed themselves in every possible learning opportunity, from participating in debate-related programs to volunteering for the debate to being among the lucky few to win a debate ticket (all tickets that Hofstra receives go to current students via lottery).</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>For the University and surrounding community, a presidential debate here means witnessing democracy in action and having the opportunity to understand the key issues, politics, and personalities in the race through numerous programs leading up to the event. For students of the presidency, the chance to see the race for the White House up close presents a unique window for evaluating the selection process, policy issues at stake, and much more. </p><br />\n<br />\n<p>For many reasons, the 2016 presidential race is historic: 17 candidates initially competing for the Republican Party's nomination, and businessman Donald Trump defying all predictions to emerge as the nominee, despite no previous political experience; former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton running for president for the second time in the Democratic Party, this time winning the nomination, but after a bruising series of contests that revealed deep divisions among constituencies. Consequently, this presidential debate promises to be the most widely viewed in history. With 90 minutes, two candidates, one moderator, and a worldwide audience, what will we be looking for in the Hofstra Arena on Monday evening?</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Image</strong>: Appearances matter in politics and especially in a general-election presidential debate, when the candidates face each other for extended discussion of their politics and policies. The very first presidential debate -- between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, televised exactly 56 years before Hofstra's upcoming debate -- is remembered for how Nixon looked unwell and uncomfortable, in part because of the bright studio lights and his decision not to use makeup -- in contrast to Kennedy, who looked healthy and relaxed. At the first town-hall presidential debate in 1992, when audience members asked questions of the presidential candidates, President George H.W. Bush famously looked at his wristwatch; he later said that he wanted the debate to be over. In a televised debate, with multiple opportunities for replay, especially in the digital era, elegant and substantive speaking can be overshadowed by an unfavorable image.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: How presidential candidates approach the debate may be as important as their policy answers. After a weak first presidential debate against former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984, Ronald Reagan, the oldest-serving president to date, disarmed critics who questioned his alertness and mental acuity by announcing in the second debate that he would not make age an issue in the campaign -- that is, he would not use his opponent's \"youth and inexperience\" against him. His humor neatly deflected a potential distraction in the weeks leading up to the election. In 2000, in contrast, Vice President Al Gore's impatience did not sit well with viewers, who thought his energy -- particularly his loud sigh when opponent Governor George W. Bush spoke -- was overly aggressive.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Substance</strong>: What the candidates say is perhaps of greatest importance to people who are taking the time to tune into a presidential debate. In his single presidential debate with President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Ronald Reagan posed a question to viewers that crystallized his critique of the administration: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? In the 1992 town-hall debate, Bill Clinton answered a question about how the national debt had affected each candidate's life by talking about the loss of jobs in his home state of Arkansas and across the country, and the need to make a national investment in people. (Bush, in contrast, stumbled over the national-debt reference -- the rest of the question made clear the person was asking about the recent economic recession -- and then became defensive about understanding the recession's effects even without direct personal experience.)</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Regardless of whether one, two, or all three of these issues will be noteworthy in the first presidential debate, without a doubt, it will be historic -- and Hofstra students will be part of that history.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><i>Meena Bose is executive dean of public policy and public service programs in the Peter S.
