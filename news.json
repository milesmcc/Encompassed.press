speech, 16 September</a>). Although it is hard to argue with Timothy Garton Ash’s view that too much nervousness on this score may lead to the stifling of healthy debate. Where I differ is in his claim that freedom of speech alone requires protection in the “safe space” that is a university. A university is not a soapbox. It is a private institution with responsibilities to its students and its staff. Most people would surely agree that there are some views (racism, for example) that universities should not tolerate. Where to draw the line between those views that, though controversial, are permissible and those that are deemed beyond the pale will always be subjective and contestable.

In issuing the call, the White House recognized that real innovation happens when the public, private and NGO sectors come together to address a problem.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking a stand and pledging much-needed aid in the global refugee crisis, companies also face an important opportunity to align their business values and core competencies with real-world issues by advocating for refugee solutions. Employees expect the places they work to be forces for good, customers want to support brands that shine brighter than others because they stand for something, and investors are looking for innovative talent approaches. There are many bright minds and committed workers among refugees and displaced people that can be a valuable part of companies&rsquo; talent pools if companies provide the right support and work with local governments to ensure that refugees are employable.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While taking a stand is one piece of the puzzle, leading companies can also utilize their core business competencies to help address the refugee crisis. This includes providing access to quality education and employment opportunities for those who need it most. A United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) </span><a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002448/244847E.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showed that only 50 percent of refugee children enroll in primary education, 25 percent enroll in secondary school, and only 1 percent enroll in a college or university. Companies can also utilize technology platforms to create quality long-distance learning programs and experiences for children and adults. As we all know, education lays the foundation for tomorrow&rsquo;s workforce. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The needs are great, and so companies are banding together. We are working with Microsoft, Intel and the NGO Digital Promise to bring cutting-edge education solutions to bear through HP Learning Studios in countries including Jordan and Lebanon. Learning Studios have already been deployed in 60 locations across 10 countries, but these are the first to specifically focus on helping refugee youth and adults acquire knowledge and skills. Equipped with hardware, software and teacher training services, these centers are enabling refugees to learn core skills and concepts that can enable them to be prepared for in-demand freelancing and e-commerce jobs to improve their livelihoods and futures in the near-term. There are millions of refugees that have valuable skills that companies like ours can tap into, in turn enabling them to accumulate work experience and savings. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refugees face extreme helplessness when they have sacrificed their homes, livelihoods, families and friends to find safety. With borders tightening and conflicts enduring, many people do not have the option to return home or start new lives elsewhere. As business leaders who understand that but for the turn of fate we, too, might be crossing seas and rough terrain to save our families, we must find ways to provide hope for refugees who are looking for paths to viable futures. Fifteen companies answered the initial White House call, and now the tally is up to 50 companies, but we need thousands more to help us support the millions who want to learn, work and contribute to society despite their status as refugees.

Stumpf was called before the Senate Banking Committee after his bank was fined $185 million for opening more than two million accounts in customers' names, without their knowledge or consent, over a five-year period.<br />\n<br />\nWe now know that these two million phony accounts, and the 5,300 employees held responsible, may not reflect the full extent of the wrongdoing. Stumpf announced that the bank had agreed to extend its review of its misconduct to 2009 and 2010, and said he would consider reviewing earlier years as well.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Witness for the Prosecution</strong><br />\n<br />\nStumpf squirmed, shifted, and shuffled under the relentless questioning of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who asked:<br />\n<blockquote>\"Since this massive year's long scam came to light you have said 'I am accountable.' What have you done to hold yourself accountable? Have you returned one nickel of the money you earned while this scandal was going on?\"</blockquote><br />\nWhen Stumpf gave evasive answers, Warren said \"I'll take that as a no.\" Warren then admonished Stumpf for \"gutless leadership\" and said:<br />\n<blockquote>\"You should resign, you should give back the money you made while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\"</blockquote><br />\n\"The only way Wall Street will change is if executives face jail time after committing fraud,\" Warren concluded.<br />\n<br />\nOther senators were also effective. Sen. Sherrod Brown worked Mr. Stumpf in a low-key but equally relentless manner, Gregory Peck in To Kill A Mockingbird to Warren as Spencer Tracy in Inherit the Wind.<br />\n<br />\nIn one of the most newsworthy (yet under-reported) exchanges of the day, Sen. Brown asked regulators Thomas Curry of the OCC and Richard Cordray of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whether they had made any referrals to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.<br />\n<br />\nCurry suggested that he is more interested in civil cases but Cordray, who made it clear he could not legally answer in the affirmative, implied strongly that the answer was \"yes.\"<br />\n<br />\nBrown also pressed Stumpf to reconsider the termination of employees for failing to meet cross-selling targets the bank now agrees were unreasonable. And in a \"wonky\" but very important point, Brown pressed Stumpf to waive the arbitration terms in Wells Fargo's customer service agreements. Stumpf was characteristically evasive on both questions.<br />\n<br />\nSen. Jeff Merkley also did well. Like Warren, Merkley called upon Stumpf to resign. He pressed Stumpf on reports of grueling conditions and high-pressure sales tactics at Wells Fargo, including hourly conferences on sales figures, bank managers coached on techniques for pressuring tellers and personal bankers, and homeless people pressed to accept checking accounts.<br />\n<br />\n\"You created a culture of cross-selling that pushed everybody to the maximum,\" said Merkley, \"and the casualties are these folks that were going to be fired because they'd lose their jobs if they couldn't meet (their targets).\"<br />\n<br />\nMerkley also pressed Stumpf on his failure to disclose the existence of the fraudulent accounts to investors, tying it to Stumpf's legal obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In return, he received the remarkable assertion that this massive fraud was \"not a material event\" - even though Wells Fargo's stock price is nearly 6 percent lower than it was before the recent fine was announced.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Innocent Bystander</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe CEO did not crack on the stand and admit everything like the villain in a Perry Mason episode. Instead Stumpf - who seems to lavish as much attention on his public image as Leona Helmsley did on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/leona-helmsleys-dog-trouble-richest-world-dies-12/story?id=13810168\">her dog</a> - traded his persona as a hands-on manager for that of a passive executive who rarely pays attention to detail. It was a portrait of the chief executive as innocent bystander. Excuses rolled down like water, and evasiveness like a neverending stream.<br />\n<br />\nStumpf even insisted he had no opinion about \"clawing back\" multimillion-dollar retirement package given to Carrie Tolstedt, the executive directly responsible for the employees who engaged in the epidemic of fake accounts that led to the $185 million fine.<br />\n<br />\n\"I will not opine on that,\" said Stumpf.<br />\n<br />\nIn a Marie Antoinette moment, Stumpf insisted that the employees who were fired had \"good paying jobs.\" The employees' pay fell in the $30,000-$60,000 range; that is, from well below to just above median household income.<br />\n<br />\nStumpf made $19.3 million last year.<br />\n<br />\nWhat Stumpf's answers lacked in credibility was more than made up for in risibility. Stumpf insisted that there was no \"orchestrated effort\" or \"scheme\" behind this fraud, for example, but reluctantly acknowledged that there might have been some collusion at Wells Fargo -- among low-level employees conspiring among themselves.<br />\n<br />\nBut, paradoxically, Stumpf announced that all the things he insisted were not to blame - Wells Fargo's compensation plans, its employee sales targets, and the training materials that convey its culture to new employees - were being changed to fix the problem.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>More Than Words</strong><br />\n<br />\nSenators from both parties condemned Wells Fargo, and the Democrats who called for this hearing collegially thanked Republican Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby for holding it.<br />\n<br />\nThat was commendable. Shelby did, however, use the hearing to mount an implicit, ineffectual defense of his anti-regulatory ideology when he chastised regulators for failing to catch Wells Fargo sooner. That's like telling the sheriff to move faster while you're trying to take away his horse.<br />\n<br />\nRepublican Senator David Vitter of Louisiana acquitted himself honorably, suggesting that Wells Fargo's actions show that it is still too big to fail. But it will take more than words to fix Wall Street. If this to be more than a cathartic moment, Republicans will need to join their Democratic colleagues in expanding the CFPB and enacting tougher regulations.<br />\n<br />\nAnd Sen. Warren is right: Senior executives who encourage or tolerate fraud, while enriching themselves from it, need to go to jail. That means appointing regulators and Justice Department officials who will uphold the law without fear or favor.<br />\n<br />\nWells Fargo's CEO faced a rough grilling today. That's a start. But John Stumpf is undoubtedly decompressing somewhere right now, waiting in comfort for the heat to die down. Wall Street's fraud won't end until its senior executives are held fully accountable for their actions - and not just for a day. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "Wells Fargo Had a Bad Day.

While we embrace the First Amendment, we do not believe that such statements should be made in the halls of justice.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>Barker&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to request for comment.</p><br />\n<p>The issue exploded Tuesday after Clark County Deputy Public Defender Erika Ballou wore a Black Lives Matter pin into District Judge Douglas Herndon&rsquo;s courtroom.</p><br />\n<p>A marshal told Ballou she would have to remove the pin or leave. Ballou left.&nbsp;Alzora Jackson, Clark County special public defender who went to court to support Ballou,&nbsp;said she borrowed Ballou&rsquo;s button and wore it back into the courtroom.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have one, but I wish I did,&rdquo; Jackson said of the pin.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>She, too, was confronted by the the marshal, who said Herndon had instructed him to ask people to remove Black Lives Matter badges or leave. Jackson said the marshal said he wasn&rsquo;t told to arrest anyone who disobeys.</p><br />\n<p>When Ballou returned to court for a case she was defending, Herndon told her the pin was inflammatory and inappropriate. He told Ballou her cases would have to be reassigned if she persisted in wearing the Black Lives Matter button.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>In court, Herndon denied his ban was spurred by the police union letter. Rather, he said it was a general restriction on political speech in court.</p><br />\n<p>Ballou told The Huffington Post she wore a Bernie Sanders pin every day for about eight months, often inside the courthouse, and never faced any issues. She said she had been wearing the Black Lives matter pin for about two months and hadn&rsquo;t been confronted about it until Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that this should be controversial. I believe that Black Lives Matter should be on the same line as breast cancer awareness,&rdquo; Ballou said.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Clark County Public Defender Phil Kohn, who came to court to defend Ballou&rsquo;s wearing of the pin, told HuffPost he believes the button is protected by the First Amendment.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;This is free speech,&rdquo; Kohn said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important and sometimes, unfortunately, some people will be offended by free speech, but that&rsquo;s the price we pay for living in a free society. It&rsquo;s critical.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>Kohn spoke up for Ballou by citing <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/15/case.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cohen v. California</a><em>,</em>&nbsp;a 1971 Supreme Court case that found a Vietnam War protester had a right to wear a &ldquo;Fuck the draft&rdquo; jacket inside a courthouse.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Kohn agreed attorneys shouldn&rsquo;t wear slogans in front of a jury. But Ballou was representing a client at a sentencing hearing on Tuesday and had a right to wear the Black Lives Matter button, he said.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Kohn also said he was &ldquo;troubled&rdquo; by the police union&rsquo;s letter, especially the claim that the button is &ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not propaganda, it&rsquo;s not hateful, it&rsquo;s not accusatory,&rdquo; Kohn said. &ldquo;The fact is you have another shooting this weekend in Tulsa and now we&rsquo;re numb to it.&rdquo; He was referencing <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terence-crutcher-shooting-tulsa-oklahoma_us_57e0411fe4b0071a6e08db5f?179o1or\">the police killing of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher</a>&nbsp;on Friday, which the Department of Justice is investigating.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is important that our lawyers draw attention to black people getting killed,&rdquo; Kohn said. &ldquo;Too many young black people are getting killed and our society has to be more aware of that.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>A hearing was scheduled for Thursday to further discuss wearing buttons in court.</p><br />\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time a judge has viewed a lawyer&rsquo;s Black Lives Matter pin in court as a violation. In July, a judge jailed an attorney in Maine after she refused to remove her Black Lives Matter pin. That judge said he believed the button <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrea-burton-black-lives-matter_us_5797754ae4b02d5d5ed2de54\">represented political speech</a>.</p><br />\n<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the full text of the police union letter:</strong>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<blockquote><br />\n<p>Dear Judge Barker:</p><br />\n<p>As the Executive Director of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, I am writing you concerning attorneys and other citizens who display &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; propaganda in court.</p><br />\n<p>We have received complaints from our member officers who believe that such displays have no place in courtrooms in which justice is to be dispensed.

The solution, however, isn't to disconnect and revert back to powerless Pilgrim living.

Maybe you're not vertically loaded properly--meaning your head, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles aren't stacking up right. Or perhaps you're just not bearing weight evenly, says Egoscue, creator of the <a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/videos/introduction-pete-egoscue/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">Egoscue Method</a> for pain-free living.<br />\n<br />\nTo find out exactly what your body is telling you, tune in. Once you start paying attention to the subtle signals (usually accompanied by a minor ache), stretch or shift positions to continue enjoying your TV, laptop, smartphone or whatever device is captivating your attention in comfort and with peace of body and mind. Use Egoscue's guide below to help translate your body's messages and take appropriate action.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/videos/office-stretches/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">Simple Stretches for Office Workers</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>When this hurts: BACK, SHOULDERS, HEAD</strong><br />\n<em><strong>Your body may be saying...change the way you sit.</strong></em><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/videos/sitting/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">Sitting</a> with your shoulders slumped forward, hip flexors shortened, and back rounded can put extra stress on your lower back, which may curve into a 'C' shape instead of its natural 'S' shape. This pain doesn't come from only sitting, but also from being misaligned. Your body is compensating, Egoscue says.<br />\n<strong>Listen and learn:</strong> Look down at your <a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/fitness/foot-alignment/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">feet</a>. You want them hip-width apart facing forward with toes slightly turned in. Your knees will want to come together, but keep them out, he says. Then pull your shoulders down, relax your abs, and roll up and forward with your hips, putting an arch back into your lower back with your pelvis. In this position, he says, you're vertically loaded. \"That's the way you sit without effort. Your body has just adapted and adjusted to what you have conditioned it to do.\" Sit like this and you could notice back and shoulder pain dissipate and even see improvements in issues, like constipation and <a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/yoga/yoga-for-digestion/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">digestion</a>, he says.<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong><a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/fitness/body-aches/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">To learn the four other body imbalances that you might unknowingly experience, continue reading the original article on Sonima.com. </a></strong></em><br />\n<br />\n<strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/videos/pain-alignment/head-and-neck-alignment/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">An Active Alignment Sequence to Correct Head and Neck Posture</a></li><br />\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/fitness/stretches-after-sitting/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">5 Yoga-Inspired Stretches for Relief After Sitting</a></li><br />\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sonima.com/fitness/foam-roll/?utm_source=huffingtonpost&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=site\" target=\"_hplink\">4 Ways to Use a Foam Roller for Full-Body Relief</a></li></ul> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "5 Body Imbalances You Might Unknowingly Experience", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sonimacom/5-body-imbalances-you-mig_b_12111566.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 5, "description": "<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-21-1474416526-1971435-BeKindHuffPost.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-09-21-1474416526-1971435-BeKindHuffPost.jpg\" height=\"377\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-21-1474416526-1971435-BeKindHuffPost-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" /></a><br />\n</center><br />\nSHUTTERSTOCK/Jaengpeng<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\"What's your advice for the mom-to-be?\"<br />\n<br />\nThe words were staring up at me from a pastel-colored card, as the giddy excitement of the baby shower buzzed around me. <br />\n<br />\nThis should have been easy. I've been a mom for four years, I just had my second baby, and I write a parenting blog, for crying out loud. But I'm also not an a-hole, so I know that there's a very fine line between giving a helpful (and solicited) opinion and pushing my particular way of doing something on someone else. <br />\n<br />\nI stared at it some more. I started writing practical tips, but then I stopped. She'd figure out the tricks of burping and breastfeeding along the way--<a href=\"http://momsanity.com/blog/article/15-things-i-wish-i-knew-with-my-first-baby\" target=\"_hplink\">plus, we'd discussed a lot of it already</a>--and it felt like a cop-out since she's one of my closest friends. <br />\n<br />\nSo I stole an extra blank card from a nearby table. As the thoughts were swirling in my head, I realized that they all had a common thread: Be kind to yourself.<br />\n<br />\nApply those four little words to your daily parenting life and everything else will fall into place. Yes, everything.<br />\n<br />\nBe kind to yourself and...<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You won't compare yourself to other moms.</strong> They walk their paths; you walk yours. Plus, no one has it all together, regardless of what it might look like. NO ONE.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll realize that the loudest moms on the Internet and in the play groups are also the most insecure.</strong> Or they're morons. Either way, take all of that advice with a grain of salt. And maybe a shot of tequila. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll trust your instincts and yourself.</strong> You know what your kid needs, and if you don't, you'll figure it out.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll learn to accept a compliment.</strong> I'm terrible at this, I have to admit. When someone tells me that I look great, I have this awful involuntary reflex that makes me say, \"Thanks, but there's a reason this top is flowy,\" or, \"I'm just wearing a lot of really good concealer!\" It makes me feel worse, and it makes for an awkward moment since the other person then feels compelled to argue that you don't actually look horrendous.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll love your body--or at least learn to like it.</strong> Sure, you may still want to lose those lingering 10 pounds, but you'll do it when you're good and ready. Also, you just created a human being. That makes your body pretty kick-ass. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll yell less.</strong> Yes, your kids will make you crazy sometimes, but I've found that yelling is a lot more about me and a lot less about them. But if I'm being generally kind to myself and not letting every little thing overwhelm me, I'll be able to take a breath and not let the situation get out of hand. Most of the time, anyway. Sometimes whatever horrible behavior is happening just needs to STOP immediately.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You won't be too bothered <a href=\"http://momsanity.com/blog/article/-to-the-ups-guy-who-just-saw-my-living-room\" target=\"_hplink\">when your living room looks like a natural-disaster site</a>.</strong> That said, always put away the Lego pieces away, because ouch.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll realize that whatever parenting craziness you're going through is most likely a phase.</strong> Not only will it pass, but you'll miss it. Well, not all of it, but certainly some of the other sweet things from that stage of your child's life. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>On the flip side, you'll realize that some things are not a phase.</strong> If something doesn't feel right to you and it doesn't go away--especially in relation to your child's physical or mental health, or yours--don't listen to the people telling you not to worry. Whatever is going on, it needs to be addressed, not shushed and pushed aside.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll embrace where you're at.</strong> Whatever you're feeling is valid. Accept that and you'll be able to let it go and move on that much faster. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll stop \"shoulding\" yourself.</strong> The only two things that you absolutely need to do as a mom? Keep your kids alive and love them unconditionally. Everything else is personal parenting preference.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll learn to ask for help.</strong> Even Superman had a band of Super Friends to help him out every now and then. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>You'll weed out the people in your life who are chipping away at yourself self-esteem--or at least tune out their opinions.</strong> Ain't nobody got time for that.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You won't feel (totally) guilty when you put on the occasional cartoon while getting ready for work and/or school.</strong> I mean, do you want to get out of the house at some point in this century? I know I do!<br />\n<br />\n<em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://momsanity.com\" target=\"_hplink\">Momsanity</a>.<br />\n<br />\nFor more original content from Dawn Yanek, check out <a href=\"http://momsanity.com\" target=\"_hplink\">Momsanity.com</a> and follow her on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/momsanitycentral\" target=\"_hplink\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/momsanitypics/\" target=\"_hplink\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MomsanityTweets\" target=\"_hplink\">Twitter</a>.</em> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "Four Little Words That Can Change Your Life", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawn-yanek/four-little-words-that-ca_b_12061362.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 6, "description": "Last week, the AFL-CIO <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/Press-Room/Press-Releases/Dakota-Access-Pipeline-Provides-High-Quality-Jobs\" target=\"_hplink\">came out in support</a> of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The Dakota Access Pipeline will poison water supplies, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/dapl-dakota-sitting-rock-sioux/499178/\" target=\"_hplink\">destroy priceless heritage sites</a>, and lead us farther away from the transition to a low-carbon economy.

The enemy is not the AFL-CIO. The enemy is not those advocates rightfully trying to stop the pipeline from being built at Standing Rock. Instead, these two seemingly at odds interests have a common enemy: the fossil fuel industry, which puts profits over workers and is the worst contributor to climate change.<br />\n<br />\nIt's no surprise that the fossil fuel industry is hostile to any attempt to transition to a low-carbon economy. For decades, the industry led a <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/su15-documenting-fossil-fuel-companies-climate-deception#.V-G7XZMrKV4\" target=\"_hplink\">targeted, well-financed campaign to deceive the public on climate change</a>. Evidence shows that the world's largest fossil fuel companies knew of the dangers of climate change for over 20 years and continued to spend tens of millions of dollars on their deception campaign. The industry secretly funded \"independent\" scientists, created front groups, and even forged letters from nonprofit organizations, desperate to prevent the transition to a low-carbon economy.<br />\n<br />\nBut, the fossil fuel industry is also no friend to workers. As just one example, Peabody Energy, the largest private sector coal company in the world, shifted millions of dollars in health care liabilities to a subsidiary, Patriot Coal, that then <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/112449/peabody-energys-disappearing-health-benefits\" target=\"_hplink\">filed for bankruptcy</a> and sought to, \"limit or discharge its pension and health obligations to 22,000 retired miners and their spouses.\" By shifting the health care costs to a subsidiary that then filed for bankruptcy, Peabody Energy increased its profits at the expense of coal miners' health. Health benefits for retired miners is particularly essential considering <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/black-lung-among-coal-miners-at-highest-level-in-40-years-af4a3ab88a4c#.hv6msgk8z\" target=\"_hplink\">black lung disease is at its highest levels in 40 years</a>, indicating that miners now are being exposed to ever more toxic working conditions. Despite what it may say, environmental regulations or the need to shift away from coal doesn't seem to be hurting the company. Peabody Energy's <a href=\"http://peabodyenergy.investorroom.com/2016-02-11-Peabody-Energy-Announces-Results-For-The-Year-Ended-December-31-2015?printable\" target=\"_hplink\">revenues for 2015 topped $5.1 billion</a>.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, fossil fuel companies are <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/ALEC_Corporations\" target=\"_hplink\">active members of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)</a>. Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries, and Peabody Energy are corporate board members of ALEC. ALEC <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/model-policy/alec-energy-principles/\" target=\"_hplink\">promotes climate denial</a> and has actively worked to repeal <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/tag/rps/\" target=\"_hplink\">renewable energy standards </a>at the state level, taking issue with their <a href=\"http://www.aweablog.org/map-successful-renewable-portfolio-standards-motivating-states-to-reach-higher/\" target=\"_hplink\">overwhelming success</a> in increasing renewable energy use. ALEC has also successfully pushed <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/model-policy/right-to-work-act/\" target=\"_hplink\">Right to Work legislation</a> at the state level since 1995. Right to Work laws undermine unions and Right to Work states have <a href=\"http://s4.epi.org/files/2012/RTW-101.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\">lower wages and benefits</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWithout a drastic shift away from fossil fuels, we will see the worst impacts of climate change. At the same time, if you can't feed your family, it's difficult to focus on anything apart from that. Base pay for workers on the Dakota Access pipeline <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2016/09/15/workers-reap-cash-bonanza-dakota-access-pipeline/90124104/\" target=\"_hplink\">can start at $37 an hour</a> plus benefits, overtime, and per diem pay. The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/solar-photovoltaic-installers.htm\" target=\"_hplink\">median pay for solar PV installers is $18.19 an hour</a>. <br />\n<br />\nBut, it doesn't have to be this way. Research has shown that solar jobs can be good jobs. In California, utility-scale solar construction built by union members<a href=\"http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/pdf/2014/building-solar-ca14.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\"> paid $39 per hour plus health and pension benefits</a>. In addition to providing good jobs, all unionized employers participated in state-approved apprenticeship programs to train a new generation of solar workers. The mean hourly wage for an apprentice electrician is almost $24 an hour plus benefits and <a href=\"http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/are-solar-energy-jobs-good-jobs/\" target=\"_hplink\">increases with skill acquisition </a>as they move through their apprenticeship program.<br />\n<br />\nPitting unions against climate change advocates only benefits the fossil fuel industry. Investing in climate jobs that pay family sustaining wages and meaningfully decrease carbon emissions makes our economy stronger and saves us from the worst impacts of climate change. Labor and environmentalists must work together and not be driven apart by fossil fuel greed. We are stronger together. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "In the Dakota Access Pipeline Fight, the AFL-CIO is not the Enemy", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/j-mijin-cha/in-the-dakota-access-pipe_b_12111552.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 7, "description": "<p>Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday fatally shot a black man they said was armed as they searched for someone else.

The trouble is the gaping wound that goes untreated in the cradle of our civilization: Syria. <br />\n<br />\nOverlooking this, or at least failing to even nod at it, as speeches by Obama's foreign policy advisors appear to indicate, is an abdication of the responsibility to protect innocent civilians. It also is a way to dodge the proverbial elephant in the UN General Assembly: that Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers have played this administration for fools. <br />\n<br />\nThis administration needs to acknowledge Russia for what it is: a global pariah that in any sane world would be ostracized and called out for the atrocities it commits time and again. Instead, it is embraced by this administration, as if it were just a misunderstood uncle who means well.   <br />\n<br />\nIndeed, the single greatest impediment to world peace today is not China's rise but Russia's arrogance. From the bombing of hospitals and humanitarian shelters in Syria to the hacking of computer servers of U.S. political parties, Russia, it would appear from a God's-eye-view, exists merely to exact mayhem. Its motives reflect those not of a revisionist state but rather of a Neanderthal caveman or locker-room bully with a Napoleon complex - it literally hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency's website as retribution for being shut out of parts of the Olympics for doping allegations - itself a heinous crime that got off with a slap on the wrist.  <br />\n<br />\nBut arrogance, especially in the hands of a country whose diminutive yet cocksure leader is an analogy of his country's place in this world, only works if there are gullible enablers. It requires suckers. <br />\n<br />\nSome of Obama's handlers recently voiced on NPR that historians will look back kindly on this administration for its many accomplishments and for taking the long view. Doubtful. Obama and Kerry's \"fool-me-thrice\" foreign policy on Ukraine and Syria will be analyzed by historians who will be slapping their foreheads in dumbfounded astonishment, much the way today's historians do when they look at the ascendancy of fascism in the 1930s.<br />\n <br />\nThe counterargument of this administration's shills is equally as puzzling. <em>Well, if Obama had carried thru on his 2013 \"red line\" pledge in Syria, we'd be knee-deep in a Vietnam-like morass and unlikely to have changed the outcome. Plus, what about ISIS? Terrorism loves nothing more than a power vacuum, after all</em>. These arguments are nonsense, and they reflect the kind of rationalization bystanders do when they fail to stop a crime.<em> Well, it would not have made a difference or I could not have intervened in time. It's a tragedy but it's not on my conscience. </em>The Syrian civil war is the international equivalent of the Kitty Genovese murder.<br />\n <br />\nIf the resurgence of right-wing parties in Germany and other parts of Europe is any indication, perhaps we are living in a post-humanitarianism world. Perhaps we are growing numb to the bite-size morsels of suffering we get from our social media feeds. Perhaps we are living in a world where evil and insidious crimes go unchecked. Perhaps Obama is just a creature of the turbulent times we live in. <br />\n<br />\nAh, but the world today, we are told, is a safer place. Intractable wars are swiftly wrapping up in places like Colombia. Countries from Cuba to Myanmar are slowly opening up. Ebola was kicked in West Africa. Nominally all the above are true, even if they do not warrant a victory lap by this White House. <br />\n<br />\nIndeed, whenever Obama glides confidently across the world stage at UNGA each fall, I always wince. That is because all roads, and deep down I believe he knows this, lead back to Syria. It is not Rwanda or Iraq, arguably the greatest blunders of the two previous administrations. In some ways it is worse, given that it is a slow-moving train wreck that has allowed his administration more than ample time to fix the tracks. Rwanda was a blur. Iraq deteriorated rapidly yet give Bush credit for his course correction (however late it came). <br />\n<br />\nI would argue that if we get Syria wrong, we have only ourselves to blame. To those who say the decapitation of the Assad regime would lead to a worse civil war or the imminent takeover of ISIS, consider the alternative of doing nothing - the world's largest humanitarian and refugee crisis since World War II. To others who fret that Syria could become another Vietnam for American forces, I posit that Syria is much more strategically important than Vietnam ever was, and we arguably have more partners in the region to shoulder the burden now than we did then.   <br />\n<br />\nObama has maintained his cool swagger as the commander in chief who does not do stupid stuff even as places like Syria burn to the ground on his watch. He is perpetuating this myth that the US military cannot solve the world's problems, and while humility in international relations is a welcome antidote to hubris, it is not a strategy for preventable suffering. <br />\n<br />\nIf the slaughter of some 500,000 civilians in the heart of the Middle East is not seen as significant enough to warrant even a modicum of military intervention, then we as a nation need to have a long and serious conversation on why we have such a large military in the first place. If passive retrenchment will define us in the decades ahead, fine. But let's get our military ends, ways, and means inline to reflect this new reality and international redistribution of power. As the world's erstwhile policeman, let's put away the proverbial baton but let's also be frank about the dire consequences of such a policy. Call it what you want - retrenchment, restraint, realism - but inaction in the face of global suffering is a recipe for brushfires turning into barnyard infernos.   <br />\n<br />\nThis is not a naïve retread of Madeleine Albright's line from the Balkans, \"What's the point of having this superb military you're always talking about if we can't use it?\" I go to school every day teaching cadets about the laws of war, the theories behind military innovation, the way the international system is supposed to work. I believe, perhaps naively, in the power of the US military to do good and to protect lives. Far from those who say we have gotten too involved overseas militarily, I believe we have become a hapless bystander to world events. There are triumphs this administration can point to, yes. <br />\n<br />\nBut so long as half a million civilians can be innocently slaughtered in the heart of the Middle East and the world can turn a blind eye, we have a long way to go. There's no such thing as an innocent bystander. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "My Disappointment in Obama's Foreign Policy", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lionel-beehner/my-disappointment-in-obam_b_12111430.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 9, "description": "<div class=\"embed-asset embed\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"></div></div><br />\n     <br />\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest: When you&rsquo;re in a serious relationship,&nbsp;a good chunk of your weekend is devoted to &ldquo;couple time.&rdquo;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a rare Saturday or Friday evening when your S.O. gives you the go-ahead to do whatever you want, so you&nbsp;<em>really</em> have to seize the opportunity.</p><br />\n<p>But as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37QVcbbqc0I\" target=\"_blank\">BuzzFeed video</a> above illustrates, your big night out rarely goes as planned.

He instinctively applied the Heimlich maneuver, dislodging the offending piece of broccoli. <br />\n<br />\nHe learned the Heimlich in a first aid class, which was clearly time and money well spent. <br />\n<br />\nWe heavily invest in prevention, early intervention and awareness for every conceivable disease from the neck down. Like my colleague and millions of others, we train adults and children in CPR and First Aid because choking and bad car accidents happen, often without warning. <br />\n<br />\nYet somehow, when it comes to mental illnesses, we take everything we know about prevention, early intervention and emergency response and throw it out the window. The subtext is that the issues caused by these diseases are someone's fault, or that people need to just pull themselves together, or that \"it will never happen to me.\"  <br />\n<br />\nMembers of Congress, aware of the kind of mental health crises that are all too commonplace, are pushing bipartisan legislation that will help create a nation of well-informed mental health first responders, a nation of people who know what alcohol abuse looks like, how to handle and support someone having hallucinations, what to do to truly assess someone for risk of suicide. <br />\n<br />\nThe Mental Health First Aid Act, championed by Reps. Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) and Doris Matsui (D-CA), requires the federal mental health agency to award grants to initiate and sustain mental health awareness training. Individuals eligible for inclusion in training would include teachers, law enforcement, emergency personnel and veterans who are likely to be confronted with Americans experiencing a mental health crisis. <br />\n<br />\nThe goal of Mental Health First Aid is to train those individuals in how to safely de-escalate crisis situations, recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness, and encourage timely referral to mental health services. <br />\n<br />\nSometimes the person in crisis is you. <br />\n<br />\nAn 18-year old girl in Central California was giving away her possessions and was on the verge of suicide when she realized she might be pregnant. Having just taken the Mental Health First Aid course in her art class, she realized she was in deep trouble, saw a counselor and got help. She readily admits that had she not taken the class and realized the symptoms of her own mental illness she would not be here today. <br />\n<br />\nBecause of Mental Health First Aid training, her suicide note did not become her tragic last words, but a school art project and a poignant symbol of how we can all save lives, and save souls, and sometimes save ourselves. <br />\n<br />\nOne in five Americans will experience a mental health condition in the course of any given year. Mental illness is a disorder just like any other - it can be acute, or chronic. It can be mild, or severe. It can have roots in biology, genetics or life experience - like the death of a parent or a nearby terrorist attack. <br />\n<br />\nAnd it can happen to you. It can happen to your children. It can happen to your neighbor, your friend, your coworker. <br />\n<br />\nWhat was my colleague's brother supposed to do when he was choking at that restaurant? Make an appointment with a gastroenterologist to remove the food stuck in his throat? Funding treatment services and supporting public education for emergency response are not trade-offs, just like teaching the Heimlich maneuver and financing specialty medical care are not a zero-sum game. We can and must do both. <br />\n<br />\nMental illnesses should be treated no differently than physical ailments. When someone you know is hearing voices that aren't there, or drowning in grief from the death of a child, or experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress from the loss of his fellow soldiers, you need to know how to help them in the heat of a crisis moment. <br />\n<br />\nWe all do.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLinda Rosenberg is president and CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "Congress: Pass Mental Health First Aid Funding", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-rosenberg/congress-pass-mental-heal_b_12110982.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 11, "description": "The monkey mind is something every modern human is familiar with. It's that incessant thought stream that no matter how hard you try never seems to settle down. <br />\n<br />\nIt's the worries that keep you up at night, the assumptions that cause you grief, the projections you make about the future and the regrets and sentiments you go over from the past. <br />\n<br />\nTo tame the monkey mind takes commitment and a deep inner desire for peace. Calming the monkey mind is the first step on the path towards life mastery. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you consciously realize that your thoughts are energy, and that the energetic implications of what you maintain focus on are actually creating your life to be based in either joy or suffering, you can be empowered to take control over your monkey mind and access the peace of mind that makes sheer existence a true gift. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Seek Common Ground and Connection </strong><br />\n<br />\nDivision is a distraction from the divine. When you see yourself as a lone wolf, you lose sight of the pack, and you struggle to survive, let alone thrive. Yet when you can look around and feel a connection to all the people you encounter, everything changes. <br />\n<br />\nYou start to focus on connection instead of seeing everything as separate. Nothing is separate. The sun in the sky keeps us all alive. The people around you complaining about their mundane daily disturbances are going through the motions just like you are, they're merely at a different point in their personal evolution. <br />\n<br />\nInstead of focusing on your independence and feeding your loneliness with divisive thought patterns, bring the focus back to finding common ground. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you do this you shift your entire perspective. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Look Deeper Than the Story </strong><br />\n<br />\nSociety, the people you surround yourself with, your past experiences and your present belief system all work to strengthen the story you're narrating in your head all day long. It's so easy to attach to your story and your thoughts are the glue that binds you there. <br />\n<br />\nIf you struggle with self-esteem and that's a part of your story then without a doubt your thoughts are the roots keeping that belief alive.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you can remain present and focus on how you feel in each moment you can start to release the constant narration and let go of the belief structures embedded in your story that hold you back from realizing your true potential.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Realize YOU Are Not Your Thoughts  </strong><br />\n<br />\nEndless thoughts flow through your mind. A thousand thoughts pass through your mind every hour, and you have two options. <br />\n<br />\nThe first option is to allow your mind to act like a hose. Thoughts stream in through the top of the funnel and are directed out, they're let go of, and they flow elsewhere without attachment. <br />\n<br />\nThe second option is to allow your mind to act like a filter. Thoughts attempt to pass through the filter but they get trapped. The filter of your mind clings to them for analysis and attachment. The filter gets all clogged up full of thoughts based in what you want and what you don't want. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you believe that every thought matters, that every thought that enters your brain is you, and that every thought needs to be examined, you become overburdened, overwhelmed, confused, directionless and prone to overanalyzing. You create internal resistance because you believe on a subconscious level that you are your thoughts.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you allow your thoughts to show up and pass away without clinging on to them in an attempt to analyze and integrate, you access a freedom that few people embody. You enter into a vibrational state of allowing which is expansive and creates space for you to access the peace and pure joy of being. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Let Go of Excuses </strong><br />\n<br />\nI don't have time. I'm too busy. These are everyone's favorite excuses for not allowing connection, acceptance, and peace to enter your life on the level of experience. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you're ready to let go of the monkey mind and free yourself from the chains that keep you stuck in your head and separated from the world around you, you stop making excuses. <br />\n<br />\nBreaking down the mental constructs that you've been attached to and strengthening for your entire life is no easy task, but it is possible and the more excuses you make, the longer it will take to break away from the mental chatter. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Develop a Drama Free Mentality <br />\n</strong><br />\nThere's a tendency in our society to become addicted to drama. The boldest example of this is television, you flick on the TV and suddenly you're immersed in a world wrought with drama. <br />\n<br />\nBreaking the cycle of drama will create more peace in your life, thoughts and relationships. Over time you can consciously train your brain to let go of the things you would normally make a big dramatic deal over. <br />\n<br />\nYour life can be whatever you want it to be, a soap opera or a peaceful expansive existence that plays out moment by moment. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Release Judgement </strong><br />\n<br />\nWhat were they thinking? What's wrong with them? Why are they doing that? <br />\n<br />\nJudgment creates an inner resistance, a pushing against what is without ever changing what is. When you allow yourself to move into acceptance, even with the things you don't particularly like, the monkey mind backs down. <br />\n<br />\nThe monkey mind thrives on judgment and drama, it's the fuel that feeds the fire of your thoughts. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you would normally jump into judgment, whether it's over someone else's actions or your own, try to practice allowing things to just be as they are. Allowing isn't the same as condoning, it's simply an energetic shift which helps you release attachment and aversion, the monkey mind's favorite snacks. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. Practice Awareness</strong><br />\n<br />\nPractice awareness of the thoughts streaming through your mind. You can't one day wake up and decide to tame the monkey mind without bringing awareness of the thoughts themselves to the forefront. Awareness is the balm that soothes the irritation the monkey mind loves to create. <br />\n<br />\nAwareness is different from attachment because it integrates with the energy of allowing. Thoughts pass by and your awareness shines a light upon them without the incessant desire to unconsciously attach to their meaning. <br />\n<br />\nIn every moment you can bring awareness to the forefront of what you're feeling and thinking. When you notice anger and irritation bubbling up let yourself become consciously aware of these thoughts and your reaction to them and then just let them go. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-21-1474416519-9228130-rsz_shutterstock_156731183.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-09-21-1474416519-9228130-rsz_shutterstock_156731183.jpg\" height=\"380\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-21-1474416519-9228130-rsz_shutterstock_156731183-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Are you ready to go deeper and start implementing techniques to help you tame your monkey mind? <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2cstGDv\" target=\"_hplink\">Click here</a> to sign up for my one-time only FREE online seminar - 3 Secrets to Calming the Monkey Mind and Finding Peace in Chaos and experience the true peace and calm that exists within you. <br />\n<br />\nI hope to see you there! </strong><br />\n</em><br />\n<br />\nLove, <br />\n<br />\nPanache <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>", "title": "7 Things You Need to Know to Tame the Monkey Mind", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/panache-desai/7-things-you-need-to-know_b_12110972.html", "source": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "reputability": 80}, {"index": 12, "description": "<img alt=\"Rick Steves with tour group\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16165\" src=\"http://blog.ricksteves.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/03-rick-steves-guiding-tour-group-netherlands.jpg\" /><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://thetravelphile.com/\">The Travelphile</a></em></p><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My life's mission is teaching Europe to Americans in a meaningful and challenging way that is economic, efficient, unforgettable, and wildly fun.

Chicago hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin contributed&nbsp;$2 million, and New York hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer chipped in $1 million. Petrodome Energy, a company owned by Texas donor Ed Bosarge Jr., contributed $1 million. American Crossroads, the once mighty super PAC founded by Karl Rove and run by the exact same staff as the Senate Leadership Fund, gave $1.3 million.</p><br />\n<p>Across the aisle, the largest donor in August to Senate Majority PAC was Alexander Soros, a son of hedge fund billionaire and Democratic megadonor George Soros, with $1.25 million. Hedge fund billionaire S. Donald Sussman, real estate and casino magnate Neil Bluhm, and the Greater New York Hospital Association Management Corporation each donated $1 million.</p><br />\n<p>These weren&rsquo;t the only two super PACs working at the congressional level to report their finances on Tuesday. <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00580381/1100491/\" target=\"_blank\">Granite State Solutions</a>, which seeks to re-elect Sen.
